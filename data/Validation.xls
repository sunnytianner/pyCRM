display option for a long title	I am a classical music lover and want to know what music is being played by looking at the title. In many cases, the most important information (e.g., movement I, II, III, etc) are cut off because the title is too long. Is there any way that you implement a scrolling title or a title displayed in two or more line?	scrolling title,display,long title,title	06 June 2013 - 04:31 AM	msohn	[The title does scroll when the track first loadsplays, at least three times.

sound presets	Hello Max. first of all: I am very happy with Your player! Thanks a lot for a good work! One thing that Im missing a lot: Sound presets: I am changing presets very often. Car radio, many headphones etc. Some of them are fine with just switching on the "Dolby" feature, some of them needs only the "Tone" tune, some of them Equalizer push. BUT saving presets does not really save all the sound features it has! It means that if I switch on the dolby feature which fine in a car - without tone or equalizer tweaks and then I switch to headphones, I change the preset, but the Tone stays switched off (althew bass and treble setting is changed), dolby stays switched on (witch I do not want), even the Stereo X does not change. So the preset saves only the equalizer setting, which is... not enough. I (and I belive that others too) woul VERY appreciate, if You extended the presets feature to other sound tweaks that we can set in this amazing player.

album art live walpaper	Hi, Thank you for your great work on such remarkable audio player. My idea is to create live wallpaper that would show album art of currently playing song if song has cover and in options one could select a default wallpaper picture that would be shown when current song has no cover or when Poweramp stops. So cover would be shown also on most lockscreens (like default aosp lockscreen that just fades original background). I think it would be great.

bluetooth avrcp - send filename	Hi! First of all Id like to say Poweramp is the best android music player for me, thank you guys for this great app. I almost exclusively use it to play over bluetooth A2DP, and I have two small features to request which would make this app perfect. 1. Option to send the filename over AVRCP if the metadata is not available in mp3 tags. On my car audio display most of the time I see "Unknown Artist" which is because my files arent tagged correctly. I spent hours tagging them with different tools, but I cant keep up with the pace Im downloading music. It would be really nice to show the file name in this case, because that contains exactly what I want to see. 2. Option to remember playlist position after changing playlists Sometimes I accidentally switch to another playlist, and then Im really angry to search where was I in the previous lists hundreds of entries - and its really not safe to search in a list when Im driving. Also, I have my favorite playlist with over 200 songs which I play usually, and after I switch to another list to show some friends other music, I must find where was I in the big list. Thanks for your time!	send filename,avrcp,playlist position,bluetooth	30 May 2013 - 07:26 AM	nitehu

any way to play a folder with playback stopping automatically?	Is there any way to play a folder of music, but have playback stop automatically once the folder s completed? Whenever I play a folder of music, Poweramp just jumps to the next folder and keeps going until I manually stop playback, which is inconvenient if I just want to listen to an album and then let playback stop automatically.

real crossfade	Hi there: I have the free version but thinking about buying the full version once I tested everything. I am a Winamp fun, so the fact that I am moving to Poweramp on my Android (Motorola Defy) is not simple decision to make. But the app is amazing, so congrats for that. I would like though, to see the crossfading options get better. The fade out and fade in of tracks A and B is not real crossfade. The ms that you can specify are working for the fade in and out but not for real crossfade. Some call it Radio Crossfade when a song fade out and the next one starts at normal volume. That would be nice. And there shoud be an icon on the main screen or the eq screen where we can configure that, so we dont have to enter the menu and do it more quickly. You coud think in a third window (eq, tonevol, cross) where you can put the crossfade options (as a control like bass), the normalize options, the gapless items etc. Thanks for the attention and keep the good work#33;#33; Leonel.	main screen,crossfade,options,free version	29 August 2012 - 02:55 PM	leoneldolara	[Yes I would like to see this too. I originally posted about the desire for this feature back in January. I did get some positive responses http:forum.poweram...fromsearch1];[There are a lot of requested features, but well add this to the list. The most popular cross fade related feature is the Radio-like crossfade. Nevertheless, thanks for the request.];[Hi Poweramp team, I want to join the request for more advanced crossfading features. In fact only one feature, the "real" feature - volume based crossfade. Having background in radio broadcasting, my two cents on the topic is that the real cross fade rarely requires manipulating the volume levels - this will often mutilate the ending of a song (imagine a song which ends abruptly by design, also known as "cut" or "cold" ending). In such a case you want to have very short overlap. A real radio crossfade in fact requires deciding WHEN to start playback of the next song so the overlap harmonizes with the ending of the previous song. That said, it is very difficult to build an algorithm which understands how to do that. The best Ive seen so far is a plugin for Winamp where you configure two parameters: 1. At what volume level (dB) of the PREVIOUS song should the NEXT song kick in (remember, no fading up or down for any of the songs). 2. What should be the maximum overlap (ms) ensuring that the volume trigger does not go off in the middle of a song during a quiet moment. Example if the volume drops but the song has another 2 minutes to go, the next song playback will not start because the maximum overlap is set to 6 seconds for example. Two additional features that will make the cross-fader rock-solid: 3. Always apply gap killer for both songs - there should be no silence at the end and the beginning of songs. You already have it, so tick. This simple algorithm works in 99 of the cases and the effect is amazing. I will be more than happy to support in the development of this feature. Great job on the app - I am still trying it out, but definitely buying the full version#33; Kos];[Thanks for the feedbackrequest. Were definitely going to add few extra options to the crossfader (FM style crossfade, certainly).Not for the mobile device, unfortunately, as decodingcalculating RMS over whole music collection takes a lot of time even on much more powerful desktop PC (e.g. soundcheck processing in iTunes), not to mention limited phonetablet battery and IO (though, if user uses ReplayGainSoundcheck for all hisher music collection, this can work). Thanks#33;];[Not really the right place, but it would be a good option for crossfade, too. Can you add a feature that your player doesnt crossfade songs if they are cue or gapless files, and they follow each other in the same album? Thanks for your nice work];[Poweramp will not crossfade such songs if you set Auto-advance Fading to "Crossfade non-gaplessnon-cue songs" in Settings=gt;Audio=gt;Fade, Crossfade, and Gapless. Thanks#33;];[I agree. Im still and eagerly waiting for an adjustable overlap instead of a forced crossfade. Why does overlapping tracks have always to be faded? Id like to tell Poweramphow many milliseconds to overlaphow many milliseconds fadeout time for the previous trackhow many milliseconds fadein time for the succeeding track (here I prefer: 0 ms).I definitely do not understand why the succeeding track has to be faded in? I dont know a single title that need to be faded in during the normal play.Im begging you: let the user adjust these three parameters.Another suggest: Make the overlap settings depending on the folder in which the current track is stored (music: do overlap; speech: do not overlap) or on its genre.Thank you very much for considering my recommendation. All the best for 2013];[Something like this: http:download.rock...l#x10-1260007.8 Of course, there could be a basic and advanced crossfade setup for those who dont want to deal with all that complexity.

balance - all the way left or right	The balance control is a good start, and is the primary reason I downloaded this app, but I need it to completely cut out traffic from the left channel when its cranked all the way to the right, and vice versa. Thats how my stereo works, thats how my car works, etc. I need it, as many others do, for some tracks that have one part on left, and others on the right.

alternatives to album art: show more metadata instead	Most of my music doesnt have album art (in many cases, its not possible to find it online, and anyway, Ive never personally really cared much for that feature). What I do have is a lot of metadata. So...theres a great big space taking up the majority of my "now playing" screen that just says "Poweramp". My wish is for a setting that says: Option 1: dont use album art : - make the transport controls bigger - show much more information about the track metadata (*) - toggle to swap this metadata display with the current playlist (and position of current track within it.) Option 2: if album art is on, but none can be found for this file, either: - display a default picture (user can select one, or perhaps a nice "music icon" ) - display a random photo from gallery app. (*) The current "infotags" screen shows the sort of thing I mean, but it should be much better formatted so as to fit into the space available. Compared to the current Infotags screen, Id change this by: moving the filename to the bottom (and much smaller), Hide the "album art: No embedded album art" section.

play only one title in list when searched for music (not the whole results list)	Dear Poweramp developers, I came to your player and found it really comfortable to use, powerful, in a slick and wide design. In the end I was convinced by its vast audio file format support and bought my licence. I only would like to make one small suggestion which would enhance my daily use enormously. I would love to have a kind of quot;one song playquot; within the search function. The reason is simple. Usually I pick my songs I would like to listen to one after another. So, basically after each song, I start to type the next song in the search box. Having searched, Poweramp plays all the songs which were found throughout the search after my song. That is somewhat annoying because it forces me to pause the list manually. Adding songs to a playlist never worked for me in this case, it is too strict. If I want to listen to more songs though, I put them together in a list. I think, this feature could be easily integrated. For example, a single file play button could be added just within the context menu which appears when you press long onto a song in the search results list.

These can be just your basic MP3 filenames (in which case those music files are assumed to be located in the same folder as the M3U file) or include either relative path information (i.e. folders from where you placed the M3U file) or absolute paths.

It should be easy enough to edit one to make a simple list of filenames using any old text editor (a quick bit of seach-and-replace will remove the XML stuff) and then save the result to a new name with an .m3u extension. Whether you want to use paths or keep everything in the same folder is up to you (a single folder might be easiest to manage if you need to do this regularly). Andre];[If a playlist(M3U) is in different folder you must import them from Poweramp menu in order playlist to show. After you have imported playlist. They appear as imported playlists. I think putting in same folder is the easiest and effective.];[Your M3U playlist file can be anywhere (as long at Poweramp has the location ticked in its Music Folders list) but if you do use a different location then you need to specify the paths for each MP3 file listed (as there is no default folder location configurable in the M3U format).

method of playing and queueing	I love Poweramp. I bought it long ago (not when it was on sale) and use it on a daily basis for hours on end. However, I have a couple small gripes... First off the bat, I often have problems regarding queued tracks and track that are currently playing. Ive posted about this in the past but either it flies over most peoples heads, or no one gives a toss. Hopefully I get some feedback this time. I like to queue up a good two or three hours worth of albums and then let it play while I work at my day job. Often I will browse for an artist in the Library, go into an album, and then select the first track, then it plays. The rest of the album is not queued per se, but will play following that first track. I dont know if this has a specific name, but I refer to it as Now Playing. My settings are such that I can go back into the Library and select more albums, long press them and queue them. The setting that allows this is in Settings gt; Advanced gt; Queue, and then Start Playing Queue is set to After Current List. Sometimes I will queue up albums without playing something first using the Now Playing method I mention at the start of this paragraph. Heres where I have a problem though, and I have a suggestion that would fix it. Sometimes Ill start playing something (like mentioned above with the Now Playing method) and then queue up more albums. I might come across a song I love, and want to go back and listen to it again. If I accidentally tap too far, beyond the first track of the Now Playing music, the Now Playing album is gone, and instead I am presented with the last entry of music in my Library, which is usually a band starting with Z. So Ive accidentally navigated all the way to the very end of my Library and going forward brings me to the queued albums , but not the Now Playing album. I have to go back into my Library and play it again. Heres my suggestion: Instead of having a Now Playing method or mode, why not make everything that is played on the fly put into the queue? Its just like how Winamp works.	queue,play,playback,album	16 March 2012 - 03:03 AM	griff	[Im using 2.0.6 now, and this issue still happens. I dont get it... No replies AT ALL?

But I think youre trying to say that either the Queued music doesnt stick, or something please explain a little clearer.];[Woo, a reply#33; Ok... quick clarification cos Im now at a point where I cant be bothered anymore... I hope I dont come across as a total prick, but as I implied in the OP, this isnt the first time Ive reached out for help with this and its gotten me nowhere. But here goes... I play an album. Then I queue more albums up. When the first album is done, the quot;realquot; queue begins. This poses a sort of issue as the first album wasnt ever part of the queue. Why not make all playing albums auto queued? Anyways, the problem is if I press back to listen to a song and accidentally go too far back, I lose my quot;fakequot; queue. The albums that were queued are intact but not the first album.];

database library cache	Hi there, I thought that maybe another suggestion might take place. This feature request targeted to solve the same problem as in post http:forum.poweram...dpostp11777 Thank you for wonderful player with great sound. I listen to lossless (flac and ape) rips from cd and vinyl and found quality of sound very true. In my local home library more 1000 albums in about 500 Gb. The most of it is jazz, a lot of good old rock, some classics and blues. Its impossible to copy all my collection to my galaxy tab even if use 64 gb SD card. So, I mounted cifs and listen to the most my collection over wi-fi (thanks to wolfson DAC on SGT, etymotics ER-4 and of course Poweramp - sound very nice). There is an issue to enjoy the music. After disconnecting local library source (shut down desctop, turn off wi-fi, whatever) Poweramp loosing all media in cifs folder except the ones it has on sdcard. It happens even cifs wasnt unmounted. For instance TTPOD keeps media from cifs even if source down or device used away, playing only media from sdcard. Rescan library take 5-8 minutes and make device unusable at the moment - nothing actually work when scan running. It would be nice to add some quot;cachequot; or something to keep quot;offlinequot; media in library. I understand that quot;offlinequot; media cant be played till the source is online, but I can choose albums (and songs) from folder view and understand if it is on sdcard or on cifs folder. Hope you find this reasonable. Cheers	wifi,storage,library,database	03 June 2012 - 07:43 AM	Lucker

be more like xiialive	Greetings -Some of the most amazing features of XiiaLive ( http:bit.lyJZKHfW ) is how: Volume control within Xiialive doesnt affect global volume media control. The XiiaLive app itself can have its volume set at, say 30, while ..XiiaLive allows other audio streams to run atop its own. Often times, Ill be listening to an audiobook via the audible.com app ( using global volume which is much higher ), while relaxing classicalnew age music playing at a much lower volume ( set within Xiialive)Does anyone know if Poweramp can co-exist with other audio stream sessions, as well as allow for its own volume settings (which dont affect global volume)?

relaunch by another app	Hi whole staff I own a Sony Live Walkman (WT19i) This handset, just the opposite of what they said, cannot read wma files. I already had Poweramp but this couldnt be as good as the one key for music this device cand do I searched for custom ROM and I found Hybrom v15. I could find some time later a way to redirect my walkman dedicaced key to search function Then, I installed LaunchKeyv1.2.1 which can launch either app (or more) specified in it I so attributed Poweramp instead of Sonys app for the dedicaced key It also provides search by Google for a short press The problem, now : Poweramp needs to be closed to relaunch. If Im in a menu, in the library, or pauseplaying, PA just wont reload.A shortcut on the desktop is OK, this (shortcut) gives me back into my favorite portable music player... Conclusion for now :Shortcut on desktop can make reenter in PAShortcut asked by an else app cannot reopen PA. Until this be fixed, Ill need to exit PA by pressing more and more on back button...

exciting new idea for albumplaylist navigation	This Idea popped into my head the other day and I havent been able to get rid of it, so I thought Id share it and see if anyone else thinks its as good as I do... Currently in the main quot;playerquot; screen there are two different ways of skipping forward and backward through tracks. You can either use the buttons below the album art, or you can swipe on the album art itself. However, in order to select a different track in the album or playlist you are currently listening to, it is necessary to go back into the library menus. A good way around this (I think) would be to remove the track skip when swiping on the album art and instead implement a feature whereby drawing from right to left on the album art gradually brought a track listing in from the left side of the screen. The track list would move in synchrony with the users finger, and would disappear if the finger was lifted. with the users finger moving right to left, and the track listing moving left to right, the two would eventually meet. The user would be able to choose the next track by moving his finger up or down until it rested over the desired track and then lifting, causing the track to play. Its quite a simple idea, and Ive probably made it sound more complicated than it is, but its surprisingly difficult to explain without pictures#33; but basically the track listing would always move in synchrony with the users finger, (however in the opposite direction). Thereby making selecting a different track from the current album or playlist extremely quick, and more of a quot;swipe gesturequot; than something requiring multiple taps. Let me know what you think, I think its a great idea, but then I might just be going mad#33;	playlist,album,navigation,ui	14 January 2012 - 10:26 PM	blak3rs	[I totally agree#33; When I swipe the album art to the right, Id like it to show me the next song that will be played, without actually skipping to the next song. If I want to skip to the next song Ill press the gt;gt; button. Im imagining something just like the iTunes cover flow.];[Sounds good and intuitive.];
changes to crossfader	Id like to see the ability adjust the crossfader control to do what I would actually call quot;crossplayquot; instead of actually fading the song prematurely in and out. I dont understand why software crossfaders on music apps work the way they do. Think about it... Listening to radio stations and the way DJs start the next track, you never actually hear the song fade off prematurely. DJs most always start the next track before the previous track has ended. If a song has an intentional abrupt ending or beginning, I dont want to hear it being faded. It just doesnt sound right. I think there should be a way for the software to calculate the actual end of the track vs. when the DB. level of the song starts to fade out and quot;crossplayquot; the next song based on that. That way songs that have abrupt ending dont get the next track starting prematurely before an abrupt ending of a song. That doesnt sound right either. I can partially do this with the PC software quot;Winampquot; by selecting the time (in seconds) that the new song starts, before the previous track ends. 5sec, 3sec, etc. but actually turning the fader portion of the sofware off. so the songs quot;crossplayquot; without prematurely fading.	crossfade,control	22 January 2012 - 03:29 PM	Interstellar	
system-wide eq for android	Yesterday I started using Poweramp and Im blown away by it. Up to now my standard for excelent audio quality was an iRiver T10 player with Sony JR20 headphones (these headphones being one of those products you find now and then that are really cheap but still excellent compared to much more expensive stuff). And even a #036;400 Sony walkman (yes, they exist) couldnt get to that sound quality. But somebody recommended me Poweramp because of the EQ, and I cant believe how superb it is. It makes those little Sony headphones sound like ten times the price, and even better, my Panasonic HTF600 headphones sound better with my Droid 3 and Poweramp than connected to my Pioneer receiver. They sound so perfect that I cannot imagine anything would sound better than that. While Poweramp is a brilliant product not only because of the EQ and tone controls, but also because of the beautiful interface, and I certainly wouldnt add anything to it, it would be amazing if the programmers could launch a new product that would provide the same EQ and tone controls but at the system level. The reason I and many others need this is that the Spotify player doesnt have any EQ and it sounds horribly flat. The difference between listening to a song in this phone through Spotify or through Poweramp is day and night. And I think that because of the huge convenience of Spotify, its something that its here to stay. I mean, you can hardly beat having at your disposal 16 million songs for #036;10 a month. I never bought songs on iTunes or Amazon or subscribed to any of those services, but this one is great and its going to have the same success that Netflix streaming has for video. But even if eventually they put an EQ to it, I doubt it will sound as good as Poweramp. The Poweramp people really know about audio. If we could have that as a system-wide EQ it would be a piece of heaven.	equalizer,version	21 January 2012 - 10:01 PM	sebaz

option to browse by filenames instead of tags	I actually like to sort my files my own way, so use file and folder sorting rather than sorting by things like albums or artists (this is, in no small part, due to the fact that I generally only listen to one or two tracks from an album.) Poweramp has always been good about this, but, in a recent update it seems to have started showing ID tags even in the folder view even though Ive tried every setting I could to try to keep it from doing this. This means it has to scan the files now and it also takes longer to show the folder view this way. It also means files are no longer sorted the same way since they sort by tags (so now two things Im used to being right next to each other may, in fact, be completely separated.) Its also kind of annoying if you listen to music from other languages and use tags from those languages, then basically romanized filenames to make actually finding things a lot easier. Since the tags arent romanized (I like to use MusicBrainz in particular for mass album tagging as Ive found it to be the most accurate and reliable database so far) I end up getting presented with a lot of characters that, to be perfectly honest, I dont really understand. I dont really want to quot;breakquot; the tags by romanizing them all (and thus making them no longer correct by the database in particular) as up until now the filenames alone were sufficient. Besides, folder view should really be a folder view without using tags IMO. Of course, all of this could be entirely optional. Theres no reason why anyone who actually WANTS to browse by tags shouldnt be allowed to if they really want to. Those of us who like seeing the filenames could get the benefits of it not having to scan the filesystem for changes all the time and sorting by filenames too however. A simple option to this effect should be sufficient and then file browsing doesnt have to do anything special beyond what it already did before: just presenting files and folders with the same basic options if you tap and hold (like enqueue Ive always loved how Poweramp handles queues and hope it never changes.)	browse,tag,option,filename	25 December 2011 - 08:32 PM	Nazo	[Sorting by folders and files still works just fine. Choose Folders mode, and then use Menugt;ListOptions to set the sort order. There is a separate sort order used for files within folders by the way, so make sure you select an option for both to sort exactly how you want. Andre];[Ah, I see what you mean. I didnt expect to have to look there. Still, I cared less about the sorting and more about the actual browsing itself. I never did like browsing by tags you almost might just as well not even use folder mode at all when youre using tags IMO. EDIT: Oops, either it was added in an update since I posted this or there has always been an option hidden right there in that same settings menu to browse folders by filename. In that case, I guess my suggestion is only that when browsing by filename, it shouldnt rely on scanning. After all, all it has to do is a simple file list. I noticed that it still requires this even because I had just added a few files and it didnt see them even when set to browse by filename instead of tag until I manually initiated a scan from the main settings menu.
