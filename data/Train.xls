bookmark feature within trackless albums and podcasts	I listen to a lot of mixtapes and podcasts, sometimes live sets that avg 1-3 hours per set. It would be great to have a feature that allows me to "bookmark" certain spots within the set I can jump to without having to rewind or forward to find my favorite points within the set.

air gestures support for the samsung galaxy s4	Hi Guys, Power Amp is already a killer music player, congratulations. I wonder if its possible to make it compatible with the Galaxy S4 air gestures. I sincerely consider your music player is wide better than Samsungs and I think this enhancement would bury any other music player out there intended to run in Android.	air gestures,galaxy s4	13 June 2013 - 05:06 AM	Hellkinder	
how can to use playlists and which format?	I dont understand the way Poweramp handles playlists.I understood that there are folder playlists and library playlists.What I wanted to do is to keep the songs from 3 or 4 albums and play them not one after the other but in a shuffle-mode. I have tried two apps, "My Playlistmaker" and "Just Playlists".I can make a m3u-playlist with "Just Playlists" and play it in shuffle mode with the player which is inside that app. If I try to open this playlist with Poweramp it says there are no files or no data in that list or Poweramp can¡ät open it. What playlist-format is compatible to Poweramp? m3u? or m3u8? How can I create a playlist wich can be played with Poweramp?Can Poweramp itself create one? And can I use this list in shuffle mode than? And another question;How can I delete library playlists? If I press the list another song is added....the folder playlists can be deleted on the sd-card with a file manager but what about the "virtual" libary playlists? waiting for help.... nb	m3u-playlist,folder playlist,playlists,library playlist,bug	12 June 2013 - 05:52 PM	Neardark	[m3u is fine for Poweramp. Are the paths to the music files the same ones that poweramp sees though?

real hierarchical folder play	I.d love to see back a feature present in v1.. Respecting the folder structure at playing. i.e: I have two folders Folder 1 [folder a;folder b] Folder 2 [folder c; folder d] If I shuffle the folder 1, it will play all the subfolders inside. Thats ok!But when I press "next folderalbum", it goes to folder c, while it should go to folder 2 and play all these subfolders!! It works great in v1.4, but actually that version cant detect my external sd card, so I have to upgrade.. Hope youll think about.. Thanks!!	folder,hierarchical,bug	11 June 2013 - 03:30 AM	altyer	
opus codec	OPUS is a new codec from the Xiph guys who are behind the Vorbis and Theora projects. http:www.opus-codec.orgOPUS is a low delay royalty-free open source lossy audio codec which was initially developed for telecommunication purposes but as it turned out its very good for archiving and streaming purposes aswell. It can be used to encode music, speech and mixed content. Its actually two codecs integrated into one: CELT (the pilot codec behind OPUS) and SILK (originally used by Skype for speech encoding). It can target bitrates from 6kbps to 510kbps and has VBR and CBR modes. Tests shows that Opus easily outperforms HE-AAC at 64kbps (http:people.xiph.o...egopusha2011) and scales very well with bitrate. It also has a very good error correction mechanism for streaming. The codec just became an IETF standard and the latest Foobar beta now includes a decoder built in. Theres an exp branch which focuses on optimizing the quality (similar to aoTuV by Vorbis). I think it would be a very cool addition to Poweramp to support this codec. It is embedded system friendly; as i know theres already an integer only decoder available in the source package. What do you think? HydrogenAudio guys are very excited about the codec http:www.hydrogena...showtopic=86580	opus,codec,open source	18 July 2012 - 10:55 PM	inagy	[I would also love to see Opus in Poweramp. I currently use HE-AAC, but Opus seems to perform better (and HE-AAC already performs admirably).];[I would also love Opus support. Speaking as one of those "Hydrogenaudio guys", yes, this codec is very exciting. Id like to help test, and one of the best ways to help test is to find places where Opus fails. One of the best ways for me to do that is to encode a bunch of music as Opus and then listen to it.];[+1 to OPUS support. I have encoded a number of files, and they sound great at 80 kbps.];[Yes, would maker a great addition to Poweramp];[Also vote for Opus support#33; Opus will be optimal music format for me on Android phone. I have audio player with 60 GB HDD and ogg music coded 160kbps, but want switch to android with Poweramp as primary music player. And for the phone with 32 GB SD card which common for all phone apps small bitrate is prefered. But at small bitrate Opus is a format with the best sound quality (according to hydrogenaudio tests). So I also request to add Opus support to Poweramp.];[This feature is something Id love to have as well. Opus is looking to be a pretty amazing codec and things like Firefox, FFMPEG and Rockbox all have support for it already, so if Poweramp had it I could encode my entire collection in it.];[Actually, were looking into adding it. Most probably will be in the next intermediate build. Thanks#33;];[Thank you very much for your support. Since very early beta Im doing test why CELT and now OPUS codec and I think it is a very promising codec since it approaches HE AAC V2 quality on some sample at 56 Kbps and the quality exceeds all other lossy codecs at 128 Kbps. I have converted all my lossless library in HE AAC V2 at 56 Kbps (fraunhofer codec) and it take less than 14 GB space on my android system. It is surprisingly small but the quality is just enough to beam sound on car speakers or bluetooth portable system (like my bose sound link), but not enough to listen with headphones. Hope to test OPUS coded files with my embedded android system and my Sennheiser HD650.];[Thanks for supporting it in the future];[Glad I gave you guys my money.];[Any news about opus support?];[Im very glad to read that opus support will come. Thanks for this useful improvement.];[Opus would be very great. Any news on an ETA ?];[Thats one thing we can never really give you is an ETA on updates...

Sorry#33;];[, including opus in .opus and .ogg files, full gapless and replay gain support. Thanks#33;];[Great news. Thank you];[Thanks Max, great to hear you finally added OPUS support];[Great#33; Please make sure to add a preamp option specific to Opus though, since its replaygain implementation use a reference level of 84 dB, 5 dB lower than normal Replaygain. It would be nice to be able to match volumes between Opus and other codecs. Edit: on second thought, it might be simpler to systematically adjust Opus reference level (84 dB) to Replaygain reference level (89 dB). If users prefer the 84 dB reference level, they can always use the preamp.];[Great work. But I have not found a download link for the dev build. Can you tell me when this feature is released with an official update or give me a hint where to donwload the dev build ?];[Dev builds are internal for developers only - is why they are called "dev builds"...Duh];[When ready for user testing, Max will post it.];[It is 3 months now since this has gone into the internal developer builds.

I want to test Poweramp 3.0 so badly.];[Again a month has passed by without any update or info. Is Poweramp still being actively developed?];[And now its been over 5 months without any news. I can only hope this shows up soon.];[Please add this opensource codec decoding support #33; All of the few players that can play this have awfull sound. The source code is free available, theres no restriction to build the decoding library, or use the common ffmpeg library.];[There was an update lately but still no lifesign for opus support in the Changelog. This is hilarious.];[When such updates will be ready, Im hoping in once-per-month update rate. The next one will include updated decoders, opus-support, various tagformat related enhancements.

albums by album artist	There is an option to sort by Albums by Artist, this is not enough. If an album has an album artist but different artists, then the screen all messy. Example of such an album: http:i.imgur.comkXlHU.png An option to sort Albums by Album Artist would be great#33;	sort,albums,album artist	25 June 2012 - 01:47 PM	Seradon	[Thanks for the tip#33;];[It should also work this way in the artists screen. Just as a frame of reference take a look at how iTunes, Windows Media Player and Google Music (the one on the market, not the one that comes with Android) does this sorting.];[Completely agreed. This is a must - Ill buy Poweramp if it supports the Album Artist tag, but I cant use it at all otherwise.];[Okay#33; Noted];[Please ignore this Album Artist request silliness. I find the current situation with android media players encouraging: there is so much space for improvement Im considering writing my own media player with this feature. It would be my competitive advantage if you just ignored this silly request.];[Sounds good sir. Good luck to you and your application. Make sure to share it when done#33; As for the actual feature, were already working on it but we wont mention it];[I just loaded Poweramp today, along with every other music player that looked nice. Poweramp wins hands down, and Ill continue to evaluate it for the eval period. I do use "album artist" vs "artist" in my collection. A simple example of a problem with "artist" alone is Britney Spears, Femme Fatale, track #6. The artist is "Britney Spears Feat. Sabi". When I select "Albums by Artist" this single song breaks off into its own "album". I know this is not a simple fix, as not every ripper populates the "album artist" tag field. Poweramp looks like the best of players so far, with this one exception. Worst case would be loading NOW ## or a few soundtrack albums, with a different "artist" on each track. Ouch...];[+1 - Coming to the end of my trial period, and from what Ive seen this is by far the best music player app Ive tried, but it really needs this feature.];[Definitely agree. With sorting music by Album Artist Poweramp (no more repeated artists whose only difference is who is featured on the song) will be the perfect android music app in my eyes. Hopefully it is implemented soon....Ive noticed that PlayerPro has the ability to sort by Album Artist...];[I realise you have already said you are looking into this#8230; but I thought I#8217;d just add my two cents as well#8230; I agree that this is a must-have feature for anyone who has used Album Artist tags with a large music collection (such as myself). Without this it is very messy and difficult to use. PlayerPro#8217;s implementation of this has a slightly odd folder restriction, which I find breaks it a bit but has some advantages for things such as "Various Artists" albums. I prefer the simpler implementation such as how (desktop) Winamp works when using an Album Artist view.];[Another vote for album artist view. Its absolutely essential.];[Hi, Id just like to add my support for this new feature. Im a relatively new Android user and Ive just discovered Poweramp, and downloaded the trial version. When I found out it didnt sort by album artist, I googled and found this page. I look forward to the feature in a future release. One hint: I know some songs dont contain album artist information in their tags - in that case the app should take the artist for that particular song and treat it as the album artist.];[Cmon, Poweramp. Get your shit together. Albums dont always have one artist. Maybe just a temporary hack until 3.0 is ready?];[Ive just found a temporary workaround. It wont work for everyone, but it works for me. I keep my music folders in a hierarchical structure, with the top-level folders named after the album artist, and these contain folders named after the album. Now I can use the folder list, and Ive set my list options to "path", so it sorts it by top-level folder first (i.e. album artist) and then by folder (i.e. album name).];[I have the same problem and so the same request. For example I just added the new album Cruel Summer which is a compilation from the GOOD Music label. So I tagged the files like this:Album: Cruel SummerTrack name: To The WorldTrack namePosition: 1Artist: Kanye West amp; R. KellyAlbum Artist: G.O.O.D. MusicIn Poweramp this leads to this: Not good The Google Play Music player does it right: A solution should be to prioritize the album artist in the album view over the artist and to add an alternative album artist view. I hope this will be changed soon, because I like Poweramp a lot otherwise.];[This should be an optional, this is what Poweramp make different from others.];[What is status on this?];[Album artist tag support would be a great feature.];
sort by album artist	Sort by album artist would be great for compilations. I know theres the Albums by Artists, but this isnt really what Im after.

Instead of omitting short words in the beginning of artists, Id like to suggest to support the "album artist sort order" "artist sort order" tags. This will also work for Firstname, Lastname artist name types.];[Love your app, but really this missing functionality is breaking it for me and Im getting tired of waiting since I bought it a year ago, even more because I see there are hundreds like me asking you for this. Please give me a reason not to down-rate it and do it now, not in futuristic V3. Thanks#33;];[This is the one feature that is preventing me from purchasing the unlocker. This should be really easy to implement and at the very top of the to-do list. But because of this huge over-site, Im already considering purchasing GoneMAD player instead, because it actually sorts by Album Artist tag.];[It would be great if album artist tag was supported.];
album list - sort by album artist	I have a large collection of music and I prefer to browse by album. In the List Options for the album list I can sort by Artist, which works fine for most albums, but compilations or albums with various artists seem to be listed under one (and only one) of the artists, rather than the Album Artist specified in the ID3 tag. Im looking to purchase Poweramp (using the trial now) but this might be a deal breaker for me. All I want is the ability to browse my music by the album, just like I would a stack of physical cds. Is this likely to be implemented soon? The albums are only listed once. Is this just a bug? Any information on a fix would be much appreciated. Thank you. Edited by bdmarvel, 13 February 2013 - 11:22 AM.	sort,album artist	13 February 2013 - 10:37 AM	bdmarvel	[So Ive tried out a bunch of other music players today, none even coming close to Poweramps functionality or slick interface. Of the 15 or so Ive tried, every one of them had the same problem (listing and sorting albums under the artist of either the first or last track instead of the using the album artist tag), so Im wondering if this is a problem with the way Android handles the album artist tag, if it handles it at all. I did notice that in Poweramp, though I can edit tags, the album artist tag is not visible. So my feature request would be to include (if possible) the album artist tage and change the Album List view to prioritize the album artist tag over the artist tag when determining an albums artist. In particular, this prioritization should occur before the Album list is sorted in order to list the albums in the proper order. Im really stumped as to why no music players on android seem to get this right. Id really like to hear some developer feedback on whether this is possible. In the meantime, Ive come up with a less than ideal work-around. I include an "albumartistfix.mp3" file (less than a second long) with "Various Artists" as the artist tag, 9999 as the track tag, "Album Artist Fix" as the track name, and the appropriate album art embedded. This allows me to browse albums correctly, but it also lists an extra track for each of these albums, which is quite annoying, and its a pain to implement. I have decided to purchase Poweramp, but I really hope this issue can be fixed. Ill keep checking back on this forum regularly to keep up on potential fixes. Thank you.];[My understanding is that this is being implemented for an upcoming Poweramp version. The official twitter account makes mention of it on Jan 16 https:twitter.comPoweramp2 so its definitely on the developers radar. I dont really know a lot about Android development, but my understanding is that Google has not built that functionality into Android, and most (non Poweramp) players rely on the stock APIs to manage the music library. I am very excited for this feature, and will certainly purchase another copy of Poweramp (somehow) because really, it will be the only software out there with this feature, and thats the easiest and most effective way I know of communicate my enthusiasm for software that provides that much value.];[Thanks for pointing me to the tweet JonBoy. Im very happy to hear its already in the works. Until then, Ive gotten used to my workaround. One other (sort-of related) issue Ive noticed though, is that albums with the same name (such as Greatest Hits, but there are other cases of multiple albums with the same name, eg. Eleventeen by Eve 6, and Eleventeen by Daisy Chainsaw) get lumped into the same album list in Poweramp. This behavior does not occur in the stock Samsung player on my Galaxy S3, so I think its specific to the way Powergramo lists andor sorts albums. I know I have seen this issue mentioned before, however, so I expect its already in the works too. Currently the only workaround I know for this is to rename the albums so they are tagged differently, but Im meticulous with my ID3 tags and prefer not to make such modifications. I suspect that when the album artist list is available, the ability of the app to check the album artist tag will make parsing multiple albums with the same name trivial. So far, I have to say Im very happy with my purchase.];[My workaround is using GoneMAD Music Player until Poweramp supports Album Artist (and Opus). I hope the day is near.];[Cant confirm this. Poweramp is a great, if not the best music player for Android, but it really (and I mean really. Ive a lot of compilations, they f*ck up my artist list in Poweramp.) annoys me that it cannot handle "Album Artist"-tags. To my knowledge, there is at least one player for Android, that can handle this tag: Googles own Play Music. I hope this groundbreaking (...) feature will be implemented soon, otherwise Ill have too look for another player.];[Poweramp library=gt;menu button=gt;List options=gt;Albums by Artist.];[Lists each track of a compilation as separate album... so this helps HOW?];[I appreciate your work, but please read my topic before replying. Sorting by artist is one thing, sorting by album artist is quite another. It seems that Poweramp determines an album by name only (hence multiple albums with the same name are counted as a single album) and they are sorted and labeled by the artist on the last track instead of using the Album Artist ID3 tag. Id like the option to sort by Album Artist, not Artist. Or better yet, for the Album List to prioritize the Album Artist tag, when present, over the artist tag when using the current artist sorting option. Also, it would be nice if Poweramp could use the album artist tag when determining albums in order to keep multiple albums with the same name from being treated as the same album. Contrary to urbanoverloads experience, sorting the Album List by Artist does NOT list the album separately for each artist. (It sounds as if hes looking at the Artist List, rather than the Album List, sorted by Artist). In the Album List, the album is only listed once, as it should be, but its labeled and sorted improperly. Take the soundtrack for Clueless as an example, which Poweramp incorrectly sorts and labels as a Jill Sobule album. If the Album Artist tag says "Various Artists", then the album should be labeled and sorted under Various Artists, and not under Jill Sobule simply because shes the artist on the last track. The album includes 13 other tracks, none of which are by Jill Sobule. Your lack of reading comprehension has made me question the wisdom of my purchase now. How can I put my faith in a company who is unwilling even to read the contents of a topic before replying?];[Agreed. Album Artist feature is essential.];[+100 from me#33; Any idea when the new version with album artist tag handled properly is out?

lower volume on notifications (short audio focus change)	Hi Poweramp is unquestionably the best music player app, but this has been bugging me: When there is a notification, right now the player can either pause the currently playing song (which inexplicably bothers me), or it can keep playing normally (and maybe missing the notification) A good idea would be to add an option to lower the song volume without pausing it, making it easier to hear the notification itself. Maybe add a slider to allow us to select how low the volume should get?	notification,audio focus,lower volume	28 March 2013 - 09:49 AM	KleptoMan	[Tru dat.

ability to add all search results to queue	If you search your library right now you can add individual tracks to the queue by long pressing, then selecting "Enqueue". However, what I am looking for is an easy way to search and then add all of the search results to the queue. The use case is this: I am assembling a queue, generally fairly long, for a working session. A number of the albums I have purchased have extremely large track counts. "99 Essential ...", "50 greatest...", etc. Very frequently, these have large subsections that could have formed a whole on their own. This is especially true with classical music where multiple distinct works are mixed onto one "album" and I want to select a single work. So, I search for the name of the work and the selection of tracks come up and I want to grab the whole set and append them to the queue without grabbing each track manually or putting the entire album onto the queue.	search results,add to queue,search,all	31 May 2013 - 07:07 PM	michaeljmcd

browse by composer	Thanks for adding support for composer tagging on FLAC files. I would like to be able to browse through classical music files by composer then choose e.g. a symphony or opera to play. I am using WAV - FLAC converted files ripped from CDs on a non-mobile android device that plays through a Hi-Fi system using a TV as the GUI for Poweramp. Either being able to searchfilter by composer or being able to browse a library group based on composer (rather than album, artist etc) would help enormously. Playing a symphony or opera also raises the issue of how to group the files that comprise the work. Once the initial search or filter has been performed on composer, providing the flltered files are displayed and can be played in flename order, this would work most of the time because most of the info required to "group" the work is present in the file name. Unfortunately the composer is not always present in the file name. Itunes solves this on its desktop PC version by allowing manual entry of a metatag called "group". I use the name of the work e.g." Beethoven 5th Symphony" to pull together the four files (four movements). This approach might also help with compilation albums in any genre.The filter for classical music is therefore 1) by composer the n2) by group and finally files are queued for playing in track name order. My only other solution is to have different playlists for each composer but this is not really manageable without having a library group based on composer. Hope you can help.	search,flac,browsing,composer,classical	29 May 2013 - 02:15 PM	Grister

relative path names in m3u playlists	First, I have to thank you for the great m3u support. I really like that I can copy the playlists from my PC and Poweramp reads and maintains them. Ive been through quite a few apps and Poweramp is the only one Ive found that will update them. Very helpful. The only difficulty Im having is that when Poweramp saves them, it uses absolute path names. Unfortunately I cant just sync them back. I have to edit each one and replace the text "storageextSdCardMusic" with "#46;#46;" so they function properly on my PC. I have a lot of playlists. The request: Please add an option to use relative path names. Thanks very much	path name,save	13 February 2013 - 05:33 AM	Vincent9756	[Poweramp can USE relative paths in M3U files, but it writes them as absolute. Once youve edited out the root paths and re-saved the files, it should work on both the phone and your PC. I guess this ties in with the recent request to allow the user to choose where Poweramp saves the M3U files too, as itd be pointless using relative paths if it can only save the M3U file in internal memory while your music is on an external SD card. Andre];[I use MediaMonkey on my PC. I have it write the playlists using relative paths and Poweramp has no problem readingplaying them. I keep the playlists in Musicplaylists. Relative paths work perfectly on both internal and external storage. However, when I change a m3u playlist with Poweramp, it writes it back out using absolute paths. I would like it to save the changes using relative paths (optionally of course) so I dont have to keep editing them. Im only talking about the m3u lists it finds in my folders, not the playlists that it keeps in its own internal database.];[Vincent, if you want to be able to select whether you want the relative or absolute path, try my app "Playlist Manager". Not only does it offer this option, it also distinguishes between Unix(android) and Windows so you could copy the playlists to your pc and play them there assuming you have the same filestructures. The Playlist Manager also offers some additional innovative features such as random selection of albums or tracks.];
support with dsp at device single core	Hello all, i back ! I was with a problem and I was reading and did some testing and was able to find something. The smart phones with single core processor as my intel atom does not have support for DSP.

please update #34;top rated#34; playlist (its useless)	Hi, first of all many thanks for this amazing app, i bought it within 10 mins of trying the demo - it was already he best audio player Ive ever tried on android#33; So I spent about 8 hours rating 4000 of my songs last night, only to find out the top rated playlist for some reason lists ALL rated songs#33; This means I can not play the list on shuffle, and its pretty pointless having a top rated playlist filled with songs of all ratings. OK they are sorted highest rating first but you can do that already in any playlist. My suggestion is to add an option in the config to only allow songs on the playlist that have a rating of X stars or higher.	shuffle,rate,playlists	25 August 2012 - 05:33 PM	aciid	[Top rated view works as it should. U can create new playlist with all yours files with 5 stars, sort it randomly and thats it.

Maybe it is implemented, but I cant find it.];[How do I create a playlist (how to I select all 4 amp; 5 * rated songs??) Also it would suck if I have to manually add each new top rated track to this playlist because this is what a proper top rated playlist should do automatically#33; Adding songs manually to a seperate playlist completely defeats the point.. and itll become a complete pain in the ass with multiple 1000s of songs youll have to sort through and add to the playlist, not to mention duplicates... gah..no, no no#33; I still stand by my point, the current "top rated" playlist is useless because it lists songs that arent top rated.. All the playlist does is list your songs sorted by rating. This can already be achieved by going on any other playlist and changing settings to sort it by rating also... so basically every playlist has this sorting feature, whats the point of "top rated" then? Anyone else think this is retarded..?];[Unfortunately me too. I am waiting for dynamic playlists automatically generated from audio tags (ID3tags for mp3s etc.).];[Guys, it can be done: Go to the list you are in, press menu on your phone and then select queue or add to a playlist without having any song selected.

allow selection of files from google cloud drive	I found out by accident that I can use my Android Winamp Player when selecting music I have uploaded to my 100GB Google Cloud Drive. It would be neat if Winamp could be allowed to also search for files in Google Cloud Drives and other popular cloud based directories. Many Android devices have very limited storage facilities which is best preserved for apps and cloud based systems are ideal for accessing music wherever you are and have internet connection. It should be possible to make a selection play list,perhaps from a downloaded copy of the song titles, and also an option to select and store songs for off-line use. In the meantime,I have found a GREAT way to store and enjoy my music wherever I am. Regds Tore	player,search,playlist,android,google cloud	14 May 2013 - 11:17 PM	sinbad7	
network device and storage support	Hello everyone, I know that this is a request that many have already made, but I thought I would bring it back up again. It would be nice to be able to access my music say on my network device or home server. In my case, I have a Seagate Wireless Plus 1 TB wireless hard drive, and I am using ES File Explorer to access my music on the device. I am avoiding storing music on my phone to conserve on space. However, I really like the Poweramp app, and if I would be able to listen to my music stored on my network through this app, I would be a buyer right away! Does anyone else share this interest? Or does anyone else have any similar ideas?	network device,home server,cloud storage	14 May 2013 - 07:43 PM	catherje	[This is an Android issue really. You can do this I believe. Youd need to root your phone, install a custom recovery then flash a ROM with CIFS support built in to it. With CIFS, you can mount network locations natively to the Android filesystem, much like mapping a network drive in Windows. You should then be able to add this location to the folder list in Poweramp. This should also work with apps like MX Player for video streaming ;-)];
sort by date modified (file time stamp)	I love this app, but sadly it (and most apps these days) lacks the ability to sort files according to date modified In my music folder on the laptop, everything is arranged by date modified.

google voice search #34;listen to#34; default action	I love that Poweramp is integrated with Google Voice Search, but I think it could go one step further and let you set a default action for the "Listen to..." command. Right now, it is essentially like doing a search within Poweramp and showing you the list of results. Since I (and Im sure many others) primarily use the voice search in my car, this causes me to still have to look down and make a selection on my phone after the search. I think it would be convenient if we could have a default action once the search completes: either play top result, enqueue top result, or show results (the current implementation). My personal favorite would be the enqueue option, that way if Im listening to a playlist but have a sudden urge to listen to a random song in my library, I could tell easily tell my phone to play it, after which it would return to the playlist, all without having to look at the screen. Thanks for the consideration.	voice to play,google voice search,in car	19 February 2012 - 10:30 PM	Jinded	[Me too please, the voice function is there for when you cant easily look at or tap the screen, so its a bit pointless if it does not do what it says... Andre];[+1#33;];[Would like this too.];[I agree, this feature is pretty much essential for anyone who bikes, runs, or drives a lot. Voice commands are the only thing I miss about my old iPod. It would also be great if you could do this based on ID3 tags, rather than by search terms. For example "Listen to Album: lt;album namegt;." This saves the confusion of having a lot of self-titled albums and title-tracks on albums. It still seems a little strange to me that Poweramp is one of the more expensive music apps and still doesnt support voice commands.];

If there are multiple albums by a single artist, it should should show all of the albums (I do like grid view) but then it should also have an album called all songs that shows all the songs by an artist. Not being able to show all the songs by one artist is the single most annoying thing about an otherwise awesome program.];[+1 !!!];[Viewing all songs by an artist certainly is possible and easy, at least in Library view; just choose "All Artist songs" after picking an artist, but I also agree with what shadumdum said; if an artist has only one album, then choosing that artist should take you straight to the track listing of that album, so you dont need to waste time choosing the album when theres only one album to choose from.];
a request for a more literal folder view	Hi all, First, many thanks for making Poweramp. It is by far the most sophisticated music app Ive found for my Galaxy S III, and I love it. To explain my request, let me tell you about how I use Poweramp. I am a DJ and a music writer, and I frequently sort through and create many folders of music on my personal computer. If I am working on an upcoming music mix, I have to decide which of many potential mp3s to use for different sections of a long mix that might last an hour or more. I might also have multiple mixes Im working on at the same time. Here is an example of how my music folders would look on my PC for two different mixes Im working on: [House mix] (this is the top folder) [Songs for beginning of mix] [middle of mix] [end of mix] [samples to include] (these are subfolders) [Techno mix] (this is the top folder, in the same directory as the House mix) [Songs for beginning of mix] [middle of mix] [end of mix] [samples to include] (these are subfolders) As a music writer, I use different folders to keep track of the different eras of music I am reviewing. Here is an example of a few basic folders I put music in: [2012 albums] (top folder) [Album 1] [Album 2] [Album 3] [2013] (top folder) [Album 1] [Album 2] [Album 3] [Music from the 1970s] (top folder) [Album 1] [Album 2] [Album 3] The problem is that when I look at my Poweramp library in "Folder" view, all of the music above appears in the same long list. I would prefer a Poweramp view that lets me move from general folders to subfolders and sub-sub-folders so I can find the music I currently want to hear. Since I use my own unique directory structure to organize my folders of music on my PC, it would be very useful to be able to page through these folders the same way on Poweramp. I understand that tagging often help you sort through music like this, but there are many cases in which mp3s are not tagged properly. On top of that, sometimes my own categories of folders dont correspond with conventional tags. So, to summarize, currently Poweramp in "Folder" view sorts all of my music into the same directory, despite how I have organized it: In the example above, I see that the directory is displayed ("Music[Main]"), but all of my music is still lumped into one long list. I would be much easier for me to be able to drill down into the different folders I have created and only see the music in those folders, as with this example: Please let me know if I have made sense. Thank you!!	sort,folder,view	03 May 2013 - 05:40 PM	Dare	[I suspect the answer may be shorter than the question in this case:In the folders list, Menu gt; List Options gt; View as HierarchyAndre];[AWESOME I had perused the options a bit, but somehow hadnt seen that. Many thanks.];
long press volume keys to skip tracks when screen off.	Now that you are overriding the volume keys to control the volume when DVC is enabled, would it be possible to include an option for longpressing volume keys to skip backforward tracks?

Is it possible? Thanks.];[Hi, Have you considered simple storage clouds (DropBox, GoogleDrive) instead of music specific ones (Spotify, GoogleMusic)? I for one dont like Spotify and although GoogleMusic is free I understand the difficulties, and I dont think it is bound to change, when youre dealing with music licensing things are not that easy, thats why GoogleMusic and others wont make it easy for third parties developers, youre supposed to consume the music only in the way they have a license for. Normal storage on the other hand has nothing to do with that, you could upload your own files and have your Poweramp connect to them as many other apps do, read DropBox , GoogleDrive, SkyDrive, Box as if they were local storage, download on demand directly from the Poweramp player, sort of like the Music player does in iOS with iCloud. I think connecting to music specific services is the wrong way, or at least consider the simpler approach first while youre still fighting to get Spotify or GoogleMusic onboard. Id be more than satisfied with DropBox support (and maybe GoogleDrive)];
animated gif covers in fullscreen play	Hi, well I got an Idea that may be interesting. It seems there are more and more animated Covers for Albums. I added the one of the new Daft Punk Single and the REM Cover. I though it would be nice if Poweramp could use the .gif version in Fullscreen mode. Lets say I got an album in a Folder. I put a cover.jpg and cover.gif in there. For the most functions Poweramp could use the .jpg and for Fullscreen the .gif. Well thanks for reading.

voice search - options	Hey I saw a topic similar to this in August, and a moderator acknowledged the suggestion, but I was wondering on the status of this: When you voice search (using Voice Actions Google Now) Poweramp will respond as an optional intent to "Listen to..". However, Poweramp will pull up a list of results as if you had used the search function in the app. Id like to further suggest that if one result is found (aka - high confidence), Poweramp should automatically enqueue the song and start playing it immediately. As nice as it would be to tap into the Voice Actions API, I know it is not possible to add custom voice actions such as "enqueue lt;songgt;" vs "play lt;songgt;". Some pseudocode: private void VoiceSearch(string#91;] VoiceToTextResult) if (VoiceToTextResult.length == 1) if (GetResultType(VoiceToTextResult#91;0]) == ResultType.Song) PlaySong(VoiceToTextResult#91;0]); else if (GetResultType(VoiceToTextResult#91;0]) == ResultType.Artist) PlayArtist(VoiceToTextResult#91;0]); else if (GetResultType(VoiceToTextResult#91;0]) == ResultType.Album) PlayAlbum(VoiceToTextResult#91;0]) private ResultType GetResultType(string text) ResultType result; Logic return result; public enum ResultType Song, Artist, Album Then add additional options toggling auto-play or whether to enqueue the result array or add it to the current playlist. Google Music does something like this, and Im sure the fine devs of Poweramp are just as capable This is one of the minor things holding me back from getting the full version unlocker, as I use this feature a lot while driving. Id provide more code but of course I have no access to the source so Im not sure how PowerAmps functions work.	voice to play,google voice search	03 December 2012 - 07:47 PM	adanti	[Bump];[I second this request.

gapless aac	Downloaded Poweramp for the Nexus 4. Sounds fantasticbest of the ones Ive tried. But unfortunately the lack of gapless aac is a deal-breaker for me. When you have a mix CD that blends the music track-to-track, its amazing how disruptive that few millisecond pause is. Neutron supports gapless aac perfectly, and for me the non-disruption of gapless wins over the better sound from your app. I hope you can add this feature sometime soon, so I can use Poweramp for all my music. (BTW, thanks for adding RealplayGain.)	gapless,aac	12 February 2013 - 06:18 AM	snydleydd	[You may try this in Poweramp menu; Settings=gt;Audio=gt;Fade,Crossfade and Gapless=gt;Cut silence (check it) also check other items in that menu for better crossfade.];[Im gonna bring this back up to also ask for this feature. I dont play mp3 on power amp, so I dont know about it, but aac is very much not gapless. (cut silence doesnt do the job, nor does anything else) Is the any chance to have this implemented? Is literally the only thing Im missing from the app right now (otherwise, congratulations on the many improvements since I bought it a couple of years ago. Definitely a good buy)];[If you mean id3v2 based gapless information for raw aac streams, this is not supported at this moment. Mostly because there are no such tracks in the "wild" found by us - and we dont add any support that we cant test on "wild" datatracks.

But I was just surprised when I encoded a couple of files for the test and found out that winamp also cant manage the gapless (surprised because, as the original poster of the thread, I tested with neutron and did have gapless. I didnt notice before because I use flac on the pc). So let me turn it around. Do you recomend a particular aac encoder to avoid problems?];[Id be interested to know if anything special needs to be done to taq an MP3 file for gapless playback - especially when Ive manually created some MP3s from segments of a long WAV file (tracks from a live concert for example).Andre];
need a complete backup solution	Lets get serious here folks. Virtually every credible Android app has a backup and restore solution, either using the Google account, an app-specific online account or saverestore to a local SD card. Poweramp does not. After spending months tagging ratings on songs, updating album art in some cases, dialing in equalizer settings, didding the many many settings within the app, dont even think about resetting the device to factory default or replacing it. All your personalizations are gone. (I dont use Titanium backup - I dont root my phone.) So either dont bother with using ratings or loading album art since all of your work is throwaway. Typically you dont get to find that out until you try to restore your device, then it#8217;s a slap in the face. Now, on the hand, the developers could chose to solve the problem that they claim is difficult. Ive developed enough software over the years to truly believe that a robust solution could be made. Perhaps its just priorities. I think it#8217;s a basic, fundamental feature that every credible app should have. This is a serious gap.	ratings lost,backup,restore	23 February 2013 - 06:09 PM	stuff	[It is planned in future: http:forum.poweram...es-in-progress];[Good to hear, although that post is from Oct 2011.

I just wanted to point out another solution to use in the meantime for anyone in need of a backup solution and unwilling to root their device.];[please PLEASE implement a backup option of playlists and all settings for this wonderful application.

allow editing tags of a file set in one operation	Hi, Id really appreciate being able to edit the tags of a whole folder album in one single operation. IE.

Other example, on one of my albums, I have a spelling mistake in the artists name (whichi its not grouped with the other albums by the same artist), being able to batch change the name of the artist for this album would be great.

smb support	Hi, many video players on Google Play support browsing shared network media via the SMB protocol though I have yet to find a music player capable of the same.

It is already possible to play one-off music files from a source which may not be located in your MusicFolders location and which dont want added to the Library (via any File Explorer type app) but it would be nice if that could be extended to playing a one-off folder too, and also allowing for files that are not on the local Android file system too.Andre];
master pause iconbutton for bluetooth playback	Hello, Well done to you for creating this already excellent player Here is a suggestion to overcome a small issue, that Im sure others may have experienced: Would it be possible to incorporate a master pause button in Poweramp and its lock screen, that overrides bluetooth AD2P control commands "Play " without interfering with the phone function? Normally when driving with bluetooth selected on the car stereo, Poweramp will start playing. I am able to view the artist info and use steering wheel controls to select next track. If a phone call comes through (car has hands free kit built in the stereo), Poweramp pauses then resumes at the end of the call. This works nicely. If I have navigation software (navigon) running at the same time, the voice from the navigation blends in over the music. The audio level for this can be adjusted independently. There are times when driving I dont want any music, however still wish to use the navigator (navigon) and hear the directions over bluetooth. The problem is if power amp is manually "paused" it immediately starts playing again. If I quite Poweramp using the task manager, power amp will automatically start up again and resume. The only way to overcome this is to make a audio track called "silence" and tell Poweramp to repeat that track. There are no options in the car stereo to pause a "bluetooth audio player", the only time it will pause is when receiving a call, listening to cd or radio. Turning the volume down in Poweramp unfortuntly has the effect of reducing the navigator audio level. It appears Poweramps volume adjusts the "master volume", rather than having its own independant control. I would have though a master pause IconButton would work, the bluetooth audio channel is shared (phone calls are also channelled). This master pause, could be cancelled by hitting the next button on the steering wheel, should you decide a little music is in order after all#33; What do you think? Thanks Jonathan.

But it would be nice if one can configure, that playback resumes only on connect of a specific device. for example: I use a bluetooth A2DP Receiver for in car audio and a bluetooth headset for phone calls.

sony xperia tablet s sd card not recognized by poweramp: sdcard2 accessible?	Hi guys, I recently bought the Sony Xperia Tablet S (16GB 3G) and did the very smart move to update it to the Firmware 6b... The plan is to store the music on the cheap (sort of, at least) 64GB SD card. ES file manager recognizes it and all music files are accessible. But Poweramp doesnt find the SD card. I only get a warning message in the music folder selection: Some storage is not mounted (which it is). The problem seems to be, that Poweramp only sees the internal storage (sdcard1) and not the external (sdcard2). Is this solvable from the app end? I (and many other Xperia Tablet S owners) would certainly appreciate the help, its the biggest issue with the device yet. With the solution I could easily wait for the next ROM to root and you guys have done everything wonders for me before ;-).

jukebox party functionality?	I have tried out a lot of different media players and I love Poweramp#33; That being said, there are things I would like to see added, unless they are there and I just havent figured out how to set it up. I have a 10" tablet that I would like to use as a jukebox using Poweramp. The app is most of the way there, I like being able to swipe through the screens and all, but here is what I would like to see added: The now playing screen is good with the album art, but I would like it if the album art could be moved from the center to the side (or top in portrait) and leave the remaining space for song information, like year, album, artist, genre, etc. Perhaps a quick button that would switch to the lyrics in that section. What would be really cool is to have a section that displays trivia about the artist or song, downloaded from the Internet. Ive seen this somewhere, but cant remember where. It would be nice to have a way to lock the player into party mode so that only certain things can be accessed, locking out access to the rest of the system, configuration, ability to delete songs, etc. I like that you can set it to show the next song, but when I queue a song, it only shows "queued" and the number. It would be nice to show the next queued song, or even better, a narrow bar on one side or the bottom with a small thumbnail for the next several songs in the queue, so people adding to the queue will know how long till their song. It would also be nice if the screen for songs, artists, etc, used album art thumbnails. For now, the only time I see those is when I look in the folders view.

sony smartwatch support	I currently own a Samsung Galaxy Note 2 and currently loathe the embedded music player as it does not allow me to only play music stored in this folder and will add all sounds that has no .nomedia file on my mobile and will have to reorganize a playlist everytime I add new music.

usb audio out for galaxy phones (s3note2)	Hi, I know this might get shot down quick for being frivolous and too niche but I thought I might try. Samsung Galaxy S3 and Note 2 users can output digital audio to USB DACs for superior sound quality at reasonable prices but a lot of DACs still dont work when they could. I have two such devices, but they are able to play FLAC files with a bit of software called USB Audio Recorder Pro. I dont know how it does it but it works, although it only plays FLAC, WAV or OGG and all my music is in MP3 or M4a Lossless for some reason. Also this software, as the name suggests, is really an audio recorder rather than a player so for choosing and playing music its pretty awful#33; So.. the big question: Do you think it would be possible to enable USB audio out with Power Amp?

playing flac audio from nas	Hi all, I cant stress this feature request more. Currently we listen to music by playing FLAC audio files on our SD cards via Logitech bluetooth audio adapters into yamaha pianocraft stereos in different rooms. Poweramp is the only player that does our music any justice. (love the player) But of couse we quickly come up against SD card storage space. (especialy using FLAC audio files) which is very limiting. I have been trying to find a way to play our music files from a NAS connected to our network. Some players do this with ease. I tried BubbleUPNP which happily plays FLAC from our NAS but lacks the audio control and finese of Poweramp. (it just does not sound as good). I quess this is mainly a limitation for those who want CD quality audio or above playing through their android device. I have also tried higher resolution audio through power amp to test its limitaions (96khz 2030kbs) but end up with background crackle. In saying that quite happy with 44.1khz.

transfer of a binary code of record without changes.	I use a stereo a bluetooth a font of HiFi of quality. It is necessary for me that the binary code, my lossless of music records, was transferred under the protocol a bluetooth without changes. That is, that your player didnt make any changes. So for example receivers work. The digital signal is transmitted without changes from the computer on an optical cable to a receiver. The receiver transforms a digital signal to the analog. At mine a font bluetooth the built-in digital-to-analog converter and the built-in amplifier are similar to a receiver. I specially bought such HiFi a font as ???? doesnt arrange quality of the digital-to-analog converter and the amplifier in phone. But, unfortunately, it turns out that your player too makes the changes to an initial binary code before to send it under the protocol a bluetooth.

customize lists within lists	In Library gt; List Options we can select a number of list types to to be available. This is great#33; However, when we view a list, select an item within a list, the way the next list is itemized is limited (sub-list). Yes, the items within a sub-list can be sorted in certain ways, but the items in a sub-list are not customizable (sp). For example: If I select to View a list of Genres and then select the Genre list item quot;Jazzquot;, I get a sub-list of quot;Genre Albumsquot;, but I would much rather see a sub-list of quot;Artistsquot;. It is difficult enough to maintain mp3 tags with the proper titles, artists and genres. The nice thing about having music packaged into single songs per file is that we dont need to have quot;albumsquot; ie. we can pick and choose songs from many albums by the same artist we like, and choose to not collect the rest of the songs from those albums. Therefore many of us have many incomplete albums from the same artist, and we LIKE it that way#33; I would rather select a Genre from a list and then be presented with a list of all the Artists within that Genre, rather than a list of all the incomplete albums within that genre, especially when I have one one song from one album, three from another, four from a collection album, and 5 songs with no album tags, all from the same artist. So I am thinking that since we already have the ability to customize what lists types will be selectable, and then customize the way the sub-list is sorted, maybe we could also have an option to what kind of sub-list will be displayed. maybe we could customize our own tree of lists gt; sub-lists gt; sub-sub-lists (:-), ie: Genre gt; Artists gt; Songs Artists gt; Albums gt; Songs Genre gt; Composers gt; Artists gt; Songs lt; very useful for classical music Genre gt; Composers gt; Songs gt; Artists Genre gt; Songs gt; Artists lt; useful for jazz standards recorded by so many artists over the years All of these ways of listing music are useful, and I imagine users would come up with more to suit their particular listening preference for any given session. I am glad I bought Poweramp, and thanks for taking the time to consider this suggestion.	customize,options,lists	05 July 2012 - 06:00 AM	gruuvin	[Yes, clicking on a genre shouldnt result in a ton of albums of the same artist.

Sorting genres by album only makes sense to people who value alphabetic sorting above sorting by artists (which is surely rather arbitrary?#33;). By this, I mean that when I look in (e.g.) Rock, I am still looking to narrow down my search further by artist, before I pick out of an album. I have almost 700 albums under Rock, but only about half that number of artists (because, like most music fans, I like most of my artists enough to have bought at least a couple of their releases). Thanks for the consideration, Tom];[After trying Poweramp and finding this quot;GenreAlbumquot; navigation limitation in the tag browsing (i.e. no quot;Artistquot; sub-list between Genre and Album), I came to these forums to see if anyone else had commented about this. In my experience with numerous standalone handheld players and android music apps, I can say that the best approach Ive personally seen to this subject by FAR has been to allow GenreArtistAlbumSong navigation WITH the addition of an quot;All Artistsquot; selection at the top of the artist list, and an quot;All Albumsquot; selection at the top of the album list. This allow both GenreArtistAlbum AND GenreAlbum navigation, BOTH of which have their place. In other words, I completely agree with previous posts asking for the ability to choose a genre, and then choose an artist, and then choose an album. This approach gives people the ability to drill down to specific artistsalbumssongs VERY quickly even when there are hundreds or even thousands of artists andor albums in the library (something that is not easy at the moment.) The addition of the quot;All Artistsquot; and quot;All Albumsquot; selections at the top of the Artist and Album lists, however, offers the additional, much-needed feature of still being able to do GenreAlbum navigation, which is necessary to easily find and play songs off of albums with multiple artists, such as a soundtrack album. For example, lets say I want to play a song off a soundtrack album where I do not know the artist. I choose the quot;Genrequot; category and select quot;Soundtrack.quot; I then select quot;All Artistsquot; at the top of the list, which takes me to ALL of the soundtrack albums, INCLUDING the ones with multiple artists on them. I navigate to the album and select the song. Its basically quot;GenreAlbumquot; navigation at this point (as it is now), which is still needed. The quot;All Albumsquot; button, in similar fashion, would allow you to easily drill in to all songs by a certain artist, or all songs in a certain genre, and play them without having to sift through hundreds or thousands of entries, and without having to manually queue anything (or type in custom search parameters.) All of this makes a considerable difference in a car by greatly reducing the number of keystrokes needed. Just to reiterate, what cant be done at the moment is to go to a genre, then select an artist and easily browse through all of this artists albums. I need to use the quot;Artistquot; field for this, which is a pain since there are hundreds (thousands?) of entries, which makes navigation MUCH more tedious than GenreArtistAlbum navigation is. Being able to actually create customized navigation list hierarchies, however (with more than two levels of sub-lists) would be ideal. Thanks for considering this featurefeature set.

album artist tag	The way I organize my music is by having an artist folder and inside that folder I have full albums of that artist. For this reason I need the album artist tag.

Was about to post this as well];[If I use the folder mode it it only shows folders that have items in them. It wont show a folder inside a folder. What I want to do is have an artist folder and inside that folder have different folders with full albums.

Check out View as Hierarchy mode in Folders gt; List Options, and also try different sort orders (I sort my folders by full path, and view in List mode, for example). You can also choose separately how the files within folders are sorted. Play around with these options to see what works best for you. Andre];[Thank you I didnt know folder mode had those options.

lyrics inon lock screen	awesome program #33;#33;#33; very happy with my purchase #33;#33;#33; just checked a few posts here feature requests etc... some people already mentioned it... like more option for the volume hardware buttons in lock mode (nextprevious song, maybe by double click or long click...) what i would like to have is an option to see the lyrics inon the lock screen just a small wish... cheers, matt	lock screen,lyrics	07 December 2011 - 09:38 AM	neuewelt	[That would be a great improvement.

ratings sync to non-itunes desktop apps	Hey all#33; Ive been searching for a music player for my phone (HTC Evo Design 4g) and I only really cared about two features: 1) Star ratings sync back to PC 2) Shuffle by Album, like on the iPod Classic.

So that will make everyone happy and implementing it in a seamless way#33; Sorry for the delay.];[In audio tags (for example ID3 for mp3 files) there are such a position, so why not to use it? It should be the easiest way. Am I wrong? Moreover, I suppose that all desktop apps can read ratings from audio tags (Winamp, WMP, JetAudio,...).];[mcx3000: I too would love to be able to sync or export ratings but spare a thought for the devs, nothing is ever simple. For example, quot;MediaMonkey includes an MP3 Tag editor (an ID3 tag editor supporting ID3v1 amp;ID3v2), AAC tag editor (for M4AM4P files), an OGG tag editor (for OGG and FLAC files), a WMA tag editor, an APE2 tag editor (for APE files), a RIFF tag editor (for AVIWAV files), and an MP4 tag editor.quot; Even if you only care about ID3v2, that only supports ratings through quot;a loose de facto standardquot; (http:en.wikipedia....atingtagissue). So yes we want ratings in tags but these things need careful research, design, testing and support.

You could create a total independent player for Windows and orothers OS computers. Obviusly you could offer like a extra player that require buy it.

Perhaps the ability to save and load "profiles" in Poweramp, where the current library is saved to the profile. I regularly connect to a (cifs) music share at home to play my music via Poweramp. When Im not home, I listen to local content on my android. Scanning my home music share (30+gig of music) takes a while On the other hand, I dont want all those folders listed in Poweramp if theyre unavailable (otherwise I would simply configure it not to scan automatically). So, the ability to tell Poweramp to load either the "phone only profile" or the "home music collection profile" would be very convenient. From within each profile you could tell it to rescan the collection and pick up any new additionsdeletions since the last time it was scanned. Ive been a happy user of Poweramp pro for ages now, by far the best music player available for android, thank you for doing such a stellar job#33; dw. ps. my current hack which works well is to maintain multiple versions of Poweramps folders.db (one for local phone-only music, another for the whole music share) and disable folder scanning in Poweramp.

option for when i play song, the next randoms will be from the same artist	I like to play songs from Google Now by voice commanding, But saying play quot;Coldplayquot; is too complicated for it, so I choose a specific song to ask Google to play for me, (lets say fix you), and so when it finish it, the next song is randomly from all of my music.. And usually when you listen to a certain kind of music, (like pop), you dont want the next one to be extremely different (like hard rock or something).. So make the quot;Random nextquot; to be smarter and play a song from the same family (same artist #092; album)..

filtered search and multi select	Hello, Until now i was using the good old Poweramp 1.4. But i get annoyed with quot;too many failed filesquot; . I now a solution for that (clear data Poweramp and media storage), but then I loose all my playlists. So i moved to the newest Poweramp. My requests: 1. Theres should be added an option what quot;Search buttonquot; do. Because now it search in All Songs. I want an option, where Search Button , searches only in current playlist ( as it was in 1.4 version). Yes, I now that there is Filter function above all songs. But if Im listening a song, which is (for example last song at the end of Playlist) , i need to scroll up to select Filter option. So 2. Maybe Filter function should be integrated in quot;Folder Player Libraryquot; bar, which is under the songs.quot;Folder Player Library Filterquot; . But theres still should be an option added to physical search button function. search with phycical button interface in 1.4 was perfect, so if you add this function Id be very happy if the search interface will be the same as in 1.4 version. And the last offer. 3. Multi select function.

3x2, 4x3 widgets and default skin designed for 7inch tabs	Hi. First of all, great player. Nothing compares to it. Can you please add 3x2 and 4x3 sized widgets for my Samsung Galaxy Tab 2 7.0? I dont know about other 7quot; tabs but the widget dimensions currently available do not fit the homescreens very well and they get messed up when rotating the screen. Also, a neat jellybean theme would be awesome. There are currently several skins available but none of them are as perfect as your default skins. For instance, the stars are out of place in Poweramp ICS Skin, etc. The default skins looks awesome on phones but when it comes to the 7 inch screens of a tab, it leaves a lot to be desired.

At the very least if Poweramp does support some sort of ID3 rating tag, its certainly possible to use mp3tag to convert between rating formats.];[I think having some sort of tag support for ratings would be better than none, which is what Im gathering at this point. Wen has mentioned that this is planned for the next release though.];[This for me is a major disadvantage of Poweramp. I agree with lowjoel, saying that there is inconsistency in the way ID3v2 tags are used is not an excuse. Many other companies have found a way to use and write rating to files, why cant the same be done in Poweramp? My recommendation would be to take a sip of managerial courage and pick one. If some apps are not supported then typically you will find that they find some way to make it happen.

show all songs option next to albums in artist menu	Hey guys, I love Poweramp, but I really miss the option to show all songs of an artist.

poweramp integration with cloud storage	Hi I have been sporadically using Poweramp on my android devices for few years now. Recently i purchased Droid DNA and earlier Nexus 7 (both 16gb storage size devices) and installed Poweramp and straight away started noticing its limitation on these new and upcoming popular devices. My one and only gripe about Poweramp on these new devices (like Droid DNA, Samsung S3 amp; Nexus 4 amp; 7) is their limited internal storage (these devices do have SD card support). It becomes almost a wasted app on these otherwise awesome devices. Unless Poweramp comes up with cloud integration solution, its practically useless on these newer devices. Dont get me wrong, I love Poweramp and its capabilities but with limited storage space on our handsets and given the size of my music library (which is close to 20 gb), its practically impossible to use Poweramp unless its has some capability to read music from my cloud storage such as Google Drive (which is where the future of these devices is heading). Atleast, Poweramp should be integrated with online streaming servers like Subsonic. Subsonic which has an open API, I presume it shouldnt be that difficult to integrate. Poweramp folks, any plans in this regard? usindian	network device,cloud storage	06 January 2013 - 03:07 AM	usindians	[Not quite sure how youre defining quot;limited storagequot;... but my Samsung S3 has 16GB on board, plus another 32GB on an SD card.

My full audio collection is over 140GB by the way (not all of which I want to carry around with me) so the cloud really is not any kind of sensible option until upload speeds get a LOT faster and decent data bandwidth gets a lot cheaper than a basic 32GB SD card.

When you double-tap the volume down or up keys on your phone, Tactile fakes a skip-forward button press to your media player and resets the volume to the level it was before you double-tapped. It works fairly well, but once in a while Tactile will simply close (the developers solution was to have a widget that tells you if its running or not) or misbehave. Id feel more at home if this feature were integrated into Poweramp, and Im sure a lot of users would appreciate it. Tactiles trick is that it effectively lets us control the music while NOT looking at our phones screen (i.e. it can stay in our pocket) and it does NOT require root. For folks (such as me) who love the features of some custom ROMs to hold down vol updown to skip forwardback on media players and want that on stock ROMs, this is awesome. As has been noted in other topics, hold-to-skip is not an option due to root requirements. The double-tap method gets around that.	hardware,pre track,next track,shortcut,buttons	26 December 2012 - 05:37 AM	LiquidRain	[Yeah, I used Tactile Player for a while, but it does crash, and I have to remember to run it all the time.

poweramp for desktop	Itll be really nice if you guys develop a Poweramp for desktops. I would definitely use Poweramp over Windows Media Player and iTunes. Right now, there arent that many good desktop media players, and so I think Poweramp is a good candidate in helping people withdraw from those infamous players. Poweramp, to me is way better because it focuses on music and music quality rather than content purchases and ads. Other music players are stale, boring, kind of ugly, and lacks that passionflare for musicsound. If you make Poweramp for desktops and enable syncing it with mobile, Im all in. Looks way better, has more and better functions, and it is actually fun to use. Poweramp totally has potential against iTunes and WMP. As long as it is basically free to use and can run on WindowsOsxLinux desktop and do all the necessary functions, I think a lot more people will appreciate it. It should be the superiority alternative to iTunes most definitely. Anyone want the same?	pc,media,version,mac,desktop	05 November 2012 - 04:37 AM	BluSmoke	[I just had to make an account to add my support to this idea, I was thinking the same thing.

I just registered solely to say that I would love to have Poweramp for windows. I miss having a synchronisation possibility with playlists and starred songs. I would prefer to keep my music-library in dropbox and then have the playlists and starred available both on my computers and my smart-phone. It annoyed me that I lost all my playlists and the list of over a 1000 starred songs when i changed my phone. To claim that there isnt a market for this and that Poweramp should just be used for android is just bull-shit. Nowadays people are expecting that the possibility of synchronisation naturally because many of the competitors offer it, and it is a feature people want. If you make a desktop version for windows, you can be sure you will get more people to use it on droids and iphones as well.

option to automatically show lyrics over album art	Long time user of Poweramp paid. I have added lyrics to the id3 tags for the songs for which I want lyrics.

I have PA set to load only from tags, and no I dont want to use a plugin, just tags.

visualization widget feature	Hello, Love the App, its amazing and I love the power amp widgets.

Currently, im using the live wallpaper quot;audio glowquot;. Its really nice and all but Id rather have visualization widgets that take up a majority of the note 2 screen that only work when playing music... Though audio glow does give me much control over the experience, Id still rather not use a live wallpaper at all for such A thing. And since im really impressed with the app and its quality over all im sure you devs could make something amazing. Or maybe do a really cool visualization power amp wallpaper that is very power efficient? In general i think Power amp would benefit greatly from unique and interesting visualizations.

changing tag of artistalbum	tagging is a very annoying thing to do (as you all know), but those of us that want to keep things in order (or a control freak) have to do it. thing is, sometimes the music you download, and by download of course i mean, buy legally - have different tags for the same artist (upper case letters, dash, etc.), which shows eventually two artists instead of one. so, i suggest that whenever you click the little down arrow on an artist, you will be able to change its tag (like a quot;renamequot; thing). this feature doesnt look like a big development (speaking as a developer), and would be very much appretiated :-) .

disable nextprev album buttons	Hi, Using Poweramp 2.06.508 on Galaxy Nexus, Standard Goggle Rom JB 4.11 Poweramp is indeed a very flexible music player. I like very much the configuration options. However, the Album Jump buttons are unusual. I wonder what is the practical purpose of these buttons. For me, this is a serious inconvenience which makes the product almost unusable. The quot;Jump Albumquot; buttons dont have a symetrical behavior. i.e if I hit one by accident, hitting the opposite button doesnt bring back to the playing position before the mistake. Example: Playing track 3250 of Album1. I accidentally hit the Next album button (PA plays track 1n of Album2). Then I hit the Previous Album to undo the mistake. PA starts playing track 150 of Album1. Of course I want to continue where I was before the mistake. The only way I find so far is to review the content of Album1, then navigate slowly in the listing and try to remember where I was. This takes a while. Granted. I am probably the kind of rare users who never jump album to album frenetically. However I do navigate to albums. For that, I just go back to the album view. Of course, this requires more button hit than a single button hit. But at least, this allows to jump to any album instead of Preview Next. Additionally this allows to review the album content and even to select any track inside the album rather than always Track #1. A touch interface is less precise than dedicated players with physical buttons. As such, touch mistake is quite frequent. I can get away with most of the touch mistakes. But a mistake on the Album Jump button is quite time consuming to fix that actually I prefer to stop evaluating Poweramp. Pleasee allow the option to remove these two Album Jump buttons and youll find me as a customer. Better yet, these buttons would be better to be replaced by fast forwardbackward (within the same playing track) BTW, you may wonder why this is such a big deal. I listen to audiobooks. Each album is a different book. Jumping from book to book by accident and losing track of the chapter you were listining is very annoying. Thanks in advance for your attention.	album,virtualizer,button	11 August 2012 - 09:45 PM	Electron	[I COMPLETELY agree#33; Those buttons really need an option to be disabled. I never use them and when I hit them accidentally, there is no intuitive way to get back to where I was. I cant see how they are useful, as who jumps from album to album in such a way? Maybe I just dont see it#33; :-) Anyway, PLEASE allow us to disable them#33; :-)];[On reason I could think of for these NextPrev Album buttons to be useful is: - When finishing playing the last track of the Album, the player either loop to the 1st track or stops at the end. This button allow to continue playing on another album. And easy workaround would be to allow the playing order to continue to next album when the last track of the previous album is finished. - People having a messy tagged library which have a lots of quot;one track per albumquot;. In that case, jumping to new album is equivalent to jumping to new track. I hope that this album buttons are not designed for this purpose because this sounds weird.];[+1 from me for this request#33; I find these quot;Jump Albumquot; buttons rather annoying. I never use them - like the original poster, if I want to go to a new album, I prefer to manually browse to the folder or playlist using the library. And Ive accidentally clicked those buttons numerous times, which is very, very annoying. So Id love to see an option to hide them. Then, those who want them can keep them and those who dont can hide them.];[What you seem to be asking for is a go back to previously played track option (a bit like an Undo feature) which I agree would be very useful. Andre];[May be there is a good reason that I miss here but I cannot conceive the benefits of jumping albums a lot like that. How do you organize your albums so that you need to jump from album to album frequently like that? And because each time you start by track 1, what is the reason that you prefer Track 1 more than any other track in the album? Navigating albums the way you do, I wonder if you ever listen to the 2nd half of most of your albums.];[I mostly listen by songs to be honest (or random) but if I want to listen to a whole album then Ill start at the beginning as the artist intended - same as I do with films really - and just work my way through it. If I want a later track, Ill skip to it. Thowback to listening to cassette tapes and CDs I guess. Andre];[+1 for the ability to disable#33;#33; being an extensive audiobook listener, I found these buttons mostly useless and frequently anoying because player is losing its current listening position];[A better option might be to have an alternative mode - mainly useful for long tracks such as concerts, radio shows, audiobooks, podcasts, etc - where the outer (currently Album BackForward) buttons act as Track forwardbackward instead, and the current track navigation buttons are replaced with Skip Forward 30 seconds Skip Back 10 seconds functions. However for some reason even though better support for longer audio tracks has been requested by a number of people for a couple of years now, it doesnt seem to get much traction (or even replies) from the developers. Its almost as though they see the word audiobook and ignore the fact that this really applies to ALL long audio files, both music and spoken word. Andre];

feature request: search for track, artist, album info on wikipedia (or other search provider)	I am alway interested to read more info about a particular band, album or track that I am listening to. One way to do this is via Wikipedia (or other music knowledge sites). I thought it would be cool, if say in the InfoTags popup (menu -gt; InfoTags), you could have a search icon next to the album, artist, and title - tapping one of those would quicky perform a search for that item in the Wikipedia app that I installed on my device. Alternatively it could open the list of registered search provider apps I have on my device, I select one, and then it searches for the item I have tapped on. MediaMonkey on PC has something similar - very powerful feature IMO. Viper21 PS. Interestingly, when I tap the Search button currently in the InfoTags popup, it offers me Dolphin Browser, Internet, Music Player, Poweramp, Winamp, and YouTube, but not Wikipedia (which I have installed).	info,search,tag	25 November 2012 - 08:40 PM	Viper21

ignore and the when sorting songs alphabetically and put numbers at the bottom.	Hey, I recently switched to Android from Apple and one of the things I missed was the great music player Apple had. Thankfully Poweramp has provided another great way to listen to my music. Im trying to customize it just like (or better) than Apples player and one of the things I wish we can tweak is more sorting options for the quot;All Songsquot; list. Specifically it would be better if the words quot;Aquot; and quot;Thequot; can be skipped when sorting songs by alphabetical order. I think thats important because I find it easier to remember a song without the common quot;Aquot; or quot;Thequot; in front. Also can you please add an option to put numbered songs after quot;Zquot; on the list at the bottom.

audiophile version...	New feature version: Audiophile version with native rendering core. Hello all: First of all, I am a HUGE FAN of the Poweramp player and have been a paid user since my old HTC Hero. Now on my Samsung Galaxy S2 and Galaxy Tab 10.1 (after a Samsung Epic and HTC G2) and still love the App. :-) However, despite how awesome and well thought out the interface and interactions of Poweramp are (and I am a UX architect by trade so that is no small compliment), the overall sound quality is still totally dependent upon the quality of the codec and DAC in ones phone or tablet. Often this yields less than flattering results. Not so, Neutron Codes Neutron Music Player. It uses a completely native code (internal to the program) 32bit audio rendering core and, to be frank, there is just no comparison in the quality of sound output. I mean, HOLY CRAP#33;#33; However, Neutrons interface is TERRIBLE#33;#33;#33; I mean bad Man#33; They claim it is a pro only interface but it simply sucks. So here is the thought: I know that Neutron Codes engine is licensable. They make quite a deal of it on their site. So, why not create an Audiophile version of Poweramp that combines your brilliant interface and interaction patterns with the unbeatable (thus far) sound quality of the Neutron player? Sure, you would have to charge like #036;8 - #036;10 for the app but those of us (and we are a growing number) that have already blown #036;300 - #036;500 on state of the art in-ear monitors and #036;150 - #036;500 external amplifiers would sure appreciate being able to have the best of both worlds#33; Any thoughts?? Thanks, Matt. mdxwiredgmail.com or mattmdxwired.com	interface,version,interaction	24 October 2011 - 03:36 PM	mdxwired	[PowerAMP (from v0.1) also uses 32bit internal audio representation and non system codecs. 32bit is not something you should advertise, as you basically cant do it otherwise. Also, actually all codecs should result in the same output within small error margin, or, otherwise, these codecs are not technically correct. Thanks#33;];[Neutron sounded the same as PA on my SE535. The only thing it does in sound processing department that PA doesnt is crossfeed];[Huh. Well, from a technical point of view I certainly stand corrected. However, I know what my ears are telling me and the results are pretty consistent across 3 different devices. As to the crossfeed feature in NCs player... it is actually kind of crap. I generally rely upon the crossfred switch built into my pocket amp. But I digress. Not sure why I am getting such a huge difference in sound quality between the two players. I do know that the experience is very similar to the first time I listened to my music as it was rendered by a device sporting a top-end Wolfson codecDAC should be the same but wasnt. The sound field was so much richer and more immersive. Anyway, cheers and keep up the great interface work. Still second to none in that department.];[While codecs could (and should) result in equal output, the following dsps (saying, PA vs N), of course, differ a lot in implementation and in settings. PowerAMP 2.0 also has 2 modes now (DVC and non-DVC versions of equalizertone), and there are 2 versions of each engine as well - non-neon and neon optimized. By neon optimization, I mean hand created neon simd code, not just a compiler switch. PowerAMP v2.0 has 10 equ bands, 2 tone bands, + 2 filter bands+delay+x-feed in StereoX effect (this effect is probably too much for now, may be I simplify it in later versions, but by rotating the knob you can get range of stereo effects, starting from light expansion to heavy, srs-like effect). Im leaving PowerAMP balance, mono, resampling, and DVC volume rampingfading out of equation (as these dont quot;changequot; sound).];[Awesome#33; So the real problem, as usual, is that I have no idea what I am doing. ;-) Just installed the beta. Will give it a whirl. Thanks again#33;];[maxmp, where is the x-feed?];

13 octave equlization on frequencies above 1khz or parametric eq	Since earbuds and headphones can vary so much, it would be nice to be able to tame the sometimes wildly-varying upper-end frequency response of these. Also, the resonance in our ear canal color the sound horribly, and a feature like the ability to this would help to alleviate that as well. I use parametric EQ on my HD-800s (home use), and the sound is breathtaking.

rewind through tracks	You used to be able to rewind through tracks, so if you rewound back past the start of the current track it would go to the end of the previous track and rewind from there, and so on. This appears to have disappeared so I would like to request it back as it is useful for listening to podcasts where there is key information at the end of a track that you just want to hear again quickly.	playback,rewind	22 October 2012 - 08:13 PM	Gizmo2501	[Agreed. If you are in rewind mode and you arrive at the start of the track, logicially it makes most sense to continue in rewind mode going backwards from the end of the previous track.

feature request: disable list item click action option	Feature Request: Add an extra option under quot;SettingsFolders and LibraryListsLIst Item Click Actionquot; that disables single click while browsing track titles. Reason: Prevent accidental selection of a track. Good for browsing while walking or on public transport, anywhere you might want to disable accidental selection of a song. If hand your precious to someone else to choose a song they cant accidentally start a new song or add 50 songs to your Queue. Proposed addition: The quot;List Item Click Actionquot; menu would gain a fourth option, the four options would be as follows, :Play and go to Main UI :Play and stay in the list :Enqueue and stay in the list :Disable Click action* I think this is a natural addition to the quot;List Item Click Actionquot; menu, all the options needed for a selected track are already present in the long click menu. The option is buried in the settings so it doesnt require any changes to the main interface, if you dont go looking for it you wouldnt even notice the change. I look forward to some feedback.	option,folder,setting,list,library	20 October 2012 - 06:28 AM	duk	[Seems like a complete non-issue to me, and not really worth the effort of a poll, but everyone is different so an option cant hurt.

+ #38; - 9db instead of only + 9db on bass #38; treble knobs	I just registered to suggest this tweakfeature#33; Ive been using the trial app for some time now and my only complaint is that you cannot reduce the treble properly#33; The equalizer is only that much useful. (Only goes to 16k and doesnt seem to reduce further) my workaround was to use it in conjunction with dspmanager in cyanogenmod but when i updated to a newer rom it stopped working. Anyways it is the best music player for android in my opinion#33;	equalizer	07 October 2012 - 12:31 AM	simongj	[Would be nice, but you always have the option of using the equalizer to accomplish this.];[I STRONGLY agree with the +- correction, as any hi-fi amp does. Sometimes with high quality music and good headphones (I use often my HD600) its just necessary to tilt a bit the reproduction curve, and doing it with the equalizer is a pain in the ass, and prone to quot;digital blurringquot; errors moreover. PLEASE, PLEASE provide this last perk to this fantastic app#33; Its quality with my Galaxy S3 is really hi-fi. A last humble suggestion: instead of a mono switch, creating a knob to blend progresively the two channels would be a nice luxury. With some not very well mastered materials the instruments are too widely separated with nothing at the center. BRAVO FOR YOUR ASTOUNDING APP #33;#33;#33;];[Great idea#33; I already bought my copy];
crossfeed (not to be confused with crossfade)	I think it might be nice if Poweramp someday implemented a crossfeed. Basically the idea of crossfeed is to apply a bit of delay and mixing to stereo sound to essentially emulate the crossfeeding one gets when listening to speakers instead of headphones (eg you hear a bit of the sound from the left speaker in your right ear and a bit of the right speaker in your left ear with a subtle delay among other things.) Probably the best info I could show for how exactly this works would be the Foobar quot;bs2bquot; (Bauer stereophonic-to-binaural) plugin as it has a lot of details and code available to all to see (albeit for the Foobar2000 player rather than something generic.) You can find its Sourceforge page here: http:bs2b.sourceforge.net It explains what exactly it does and how it is beneficial better than I can really. Basically this reduces or eliminates listening fatigue for most people when using headphones for a long period of time even though it is, overall, a pretty subtle effect. It does use more CPU power unfortunately, but from what I can tell, its actually a pretty small increase overall. Well, obviously it wouldnt be a setting thats turned on by default, but I think it could be overall beneficial to people as the majority of people actually using Poweramp are probably listening with headphones. PS. Sorry for so many requests at once. Ive been meaning to post about each of these in turn for quite a while, but just didnt get around to it until now.	sound,headphones,crossfeed	26 December 2011 - 04:59 AM	Nazo	[Sounds really nice, that would be good.];[This would be a really useful option for Earphone user.];[Seconded.

last.fm love button and auto-dj function	Three requests. 2. One thats probably a lot more complex: Auto-DJ function. I really like the auto-dj function in Musicbee in combination with dynamic autoplaylists. Heres how it works: I create several auto-playlists. The program searches for music which fits in certain conditions (e.g. Genre is Rock, or Playcount is 0, etc). Than I let the auto-DJ function select random songs from a selected auto-playlist. There are more options here which are also great but I wont go into them here. It would be great if Poweramp could switch to auto-DJ when a set playlist reaches the end. 3. Proper working Stereo X function on SGS2 (see bugs forum). Poweramp is already the best music player but these things could make it a real killer.	button,playlist,lastfm	25 January 2012 - 02:03 PM	cornholio	[+1];[Maybe not replace star ratings, but compliment them?

plain background	Hey all I love Power Amp and it is the only player that allows me to save playlists when my music is on the SD card (with other players the playlists are empty after a restart). However I really dont like that gradient background that is displayed behind the album covers. It would be great if there was an option to disable that and just have a black background. It would suit the simple design style of Power Amp better. Even if I zoom the covers the gradient is still visible in landscape. Also I have found no skins that feature a black or plain background. Another nice feature would be dropbox support (play in background).

add option: headset-connect resumes play if paused by its removal	Before you assume this is a mere repetion of what has been suggested earlier, allow me to specify:A user did ask a SIMILAR question for a month ago, but far from identical. I DO NOT want you to CHANGE this behaviour, but asking to ADD an OPTION so it will resume play only when the music is interrupted by removing the headset.Why I am so cheeky to ask for this, is that I know you are brilliant with coding, as everyone can witness by looking at the vastness of options and features you have in your player. I could add, although it may be forfeited since it has been that long time it was posted, that an admin, called quot;adminquot;, replied to a request identical to mine, two years ago, and stated that he wanted to add such an option (not removing or replace the function you have already).

sync play count and skip count with itunes	Hello, I bought Poweramp 2 years ago. It was the best on the android market. But it seems that a lot of players have made progress. First I realised that the sound of the native player was better (with the system 5.1 sound). I tried to reproduice this on my Poweramp Eq, but it was to difficult. Last but not least, I use smart playlist on itunes. My smartplaylits use the play count and the skip count to be updated. I use syncr to synchronise my songs though wifi.

However, while i have only the artists view enabled, i still have to select it whenever going to the library. Is it possible for Poweramp to automatically show the artists view (or any view) if no other view is enabled Edit: Couple other requests. When an artist only has one album, please automatically go to track mode, rather than having to select that lone album. A way to disable folders view completely (allows me to remove the bar).

multiple-folder sets	Currently when you want to view your songs you have two panels quot;Foldersquot; and quot;Libraryquot; at the bottom of the screen. The quot;Foldersquot; panel is configured by selecting which folders are scanned for audio files. It would be usefull if I was given the ability to dynamically create and delete different folder sets to replace, augment, or categorize what I wish to listen to by folder locations. This solves a set of user stories directly tied to have audio files that are not music such as ebooks and podcasts. While using playlists does work around such issues, it is slow to work with more than a few files and adds overhead when aquiring new audio files of any type. For example, consider that I have the following directories - sdcardmusic- extsdcardamazonmp3 - sdcardebooks - sdcardpodcasts-extsdcardBeyondPod It would be nice if I could define three different folder sets: quot;Musicquot;, quot;eBooksquot;, and quot;Pod Castsquot;. The Music set would incude the first two directorys music and amazonmp3. The other two categories would follow the same pattern. The use case to manage folder sets could be something along these lines: User: Open Poweramp (Existing)User: Tap Menu Button (Existing)User: Tap Settings (Existing)User: Tap Folders and Library (Existing)User: Tap Folder Sets (Existing item is Music Folders)System: Display a list of Folder Sets (Default is just 1 Folder Set named quot;Folderquot;)User: Taps the X next to the default quot;Folderquot;System: Promps user to delete the folder setUser: Taps OkSystem: deletes the folder setUser: Taps create new folder setSystem: Prompts for new folder set nameUser: enters new folder set name amp; presses okSystem: Creates new folder setUser: Taps new folder setSystem: shows something similar to the current folder selectorUser: ChecksUnchecks various foldersUser: Clicks oksaveSystem: Saves new folder set and scans if needed Then you can activate a Folder Set similar to a play list and have everything from that set of folders play during randomshuffle.	screen,ebook,list,library,folder,e-book	05 October 2012 - 01:50 PM	Raegx

limit play to a folder	Hi, Can you add the ability to limit play to a particular folder in the hierarchy? I know that you can long press a folder and select playshuffle and it works, but it works by creating a temporary list with all the songs in the folder and its subfolders, and shuffle lists doesnt work (there is only one big list). If i dont select a particular folder but turn on [shuffle lists, songs in order], the whole library is shuffled. I want the ability to shuffle folders within a top level folder, but play songs in each folder in order. Right now, i am able to solve this problem by changing the music folder to one of the top level folders i am interested in.(I have to go to menu-gt;settings-gt;folders and library-gt;music folders). Then i play any song and it limits the play to the folder and its subfolders while shuffling the sub-folders. it works, but is a bit cumbersome. Could you provide a shortcut on the main screen or the menu, or an easier way to select the music folder instead of the 4 step process above?

please add poweramp to quick search results	I have spent the better part of a day looking for a way to open a music file in Poweramp from Androids quot;Quick Searchquot; function on both Gingerbread and ICS. From what I can tell, it is not currently possible as the players that do give results (such as Google Play Music and Player Pro) seem to be passing along their own internal search results rather than actually opening a file in an external application (although Im no dev so I could have that all wrong). Please consider adding the functionality to add Poweramp as a quot;searchable itemquot; from Quick Search.

menu button	Is it possible to have access to the menu from the screen? My hard button is damaged so I cant change any settings as there is no other way to get to the menu. Most apps have a screen button and dont totally rely on the hardware button.	menu button,button,screen	17 September 2012 - 08:57 PM	skicoach	[Poweramp doesnt have one because it uses your phones ID to know if it has a hardware Menu button and that way either displays the on-screen one or not. The next version of Poweramp will handle the whole menu system better, but thats all we have for now. Sorry];
very simple program control	It would be a very useful feature if while the screen is blank that the volume button could be used to change the song and the volume. Often my phone is on my belt and I am doing other tasks while listening to music. If I want to skip a song, etc I have to stop what I am doing, Grab the phone, unlock it then change the song. I would like to see the volume button work as shown below (while the screen is blank) A long press of the volume up button would adjust the volume up A long press of the volume down button would adjust the volume down A short press of the volume up button would rewind the current song to the beginning A double short press would go to the previous song A short press of the volume down button would go to the next song In other words the short press of the buttons wouldcould act like the forward and back buttons as well as a volume button	hardware,volume button	19 February 2012 - 03:56 PM	eaglesoftware	[+];[Sounds good to me would be a nice feature +1];[I like this feature request];[i dont like this feature long press will cause the vol up down jumped a large step, it will hurt my ears...];

manual song sorting in playlists	I would very much like to manually sort songs in each of my playlists. There are lots of auto sorting modes but not one that puts the songs in the order I want. I am a simple guy, in each playlist I would like my favorite song as the first one, at top of list, my second favorite song as the second one.....etc... and be able to move any song to a new spot in list manually.

saved pause for certain filesfolder? for podcasts	I once had an mp3 player with a specific quot;podcastsquot; folder - files in there would save their pause-point, which was great because you could stop listening to an hour long podcast mid way through, listen to some music then return to it. It would be great if you could assign a specific folder or similar to have these saved-pause properties.. remembering where i was in a podcast is the one thing i find annoying with Poweramp. thanks#33;	pause,folder,podcast	09 September 2012 - 02:28 PM	jeffcapeshop

option to prompt when not using bluetooth headset to play song	it is a embarrassing situation that the bluetooth is suddenly disconnected, but not yet realized.

shuffle please. not random	could you please add a shuffle feature? everybody imlements quot;shufflequot; but its really a poorly implemented quot;randomquot; feature. Heres my issue. I have 288 songs on my phone. I only ever get to hear the same 50 because everybodys player only cycles through the same damn 50 songs. To shuffle: build a list. sort it randomly. play it serially. when you hit the end of the list, stop. this way Ill be guarenteed to not hear the same song more than once.	sort,list,shuffle	25 August 2012 - 02:12 AM	PsychoEddie	[This function is already in Poweramp, but a little bit hidden. - Choose a folder with music files by press amp; hold on it, - Choose quot;Add to playlistquot;, - Go to library gt; Playlists, - Choose your new playlist (press amp; hold), - Choose quot;sort byquot; or similar, - Choose (quot;randomquot; or something like that) and quot;sort againquot; Names can be different because I use polish translation. It could be implemented in better way (more visible) but this is not a most important feature to addchange for me.];[thatll work. thank you.];[Poweramp always shuffles (Starting from v1.0), never picks random songs one by one. Though, until v.2.0, if you close Poweramp or somehow else reload Poweramp or playlists, shuffle history is lost (its in memory only). Poweramp starting from v2.0 uses quot;permanent shuffle sessionsquot;. This means, when you start new shuffle session (i.e. change Shuffle mode or start new playlist in shuffle mode, or start new song from some playlist in shuffle mode), Poweramp will: 1. shuffle list properly, as previously. Basically list items are randomly reordered and kept this way. 2. store all played songs in quot;historyquot; 3. if Poweramp restarted, phone restarted, etc, Poweramp will resume shuffle session exactly where it left it - and continue to play the shuffled songs which werent played yet. Played songs wont be picked up and played again. Thanks#33;];[No player that I know has this feature yet, but it would be very cool if the player would allow you to start a shuffle set and suspend it while playing another song temporarily - either by allowing you to to save the state of the shuffle or by just including a manually selected song as part of the ongoing shuffle, or both.];[If you put the song(s) you wish to play into the queue this is what happens. Make sure you have repitition option set to quot;Advance Listquot;, though, or the queue will repeat.];[Why should it stop. Shouldnt it rebuild a new list, and go right on playing?];
dynamic playlist	I am eagerly waiting for the dynamic playlist support update like what we have seen in iTunes music player.

Keep it up though, as soon as this feature is available Poweramp will be well above every other music player (it already is for the most part)];[+1 What I can add to this topic is an option to filter tags.

show genre in play queue and keep track of last played date	Awesome app#33;#33;#33; Im a DJ that is attempting to utilze this app to replacesupplement my laptop while DJ-ing. Two items that would be nice to have are: 1) The ability to show the Genre for each song in the play Queue. Maybe an option that would allow you to substitute the album name in the play queue with the Genre tag instead. 2) Is there any way to keep track of the last played date of a song and the be able to view it with the songs listings when browsing the library?

So, bascially when you view the InfoTags for a song you could see the date of the last time you played the song. This is an awesome app that is very robust and reliable#33; Cheers,Matt];

fun - vocal remover and other effects	Who doesnt like taking the head phone jack a little bit out, to make the vocals sound like in a long hallway? Or making some of the synths a bit weird? Sadly, not all headphone jacks can do this, so what I am requesting, is a vocal remover knob (optional ofcourse) Make it in a category along with other effects, name? Experimental, Fun, Misc or Effects, I already love this app, so what about some fun in it too? Also effects or enchantment knobs could go there, along with stereo x, layout? Try making a button that opens this little window with all these effects, or maybe another screen? You name it. Anyway I would like to see some of the community give ideas for the effects , and as always, constructive criticism is appreciated.

option to disable poweramps custom library	You guys have created a fantastic app, but I have just one request: give us the option to choose which library we would like to use, Poweramps built in library, or our system library. I have a Galaxy S, and it used to be that your amp worked perfectly in this area. In fact playlists and the music library would update instantaneously, no rescan necessary. The moment a song was added to the device it appeared in my Poweramp library, I would be searching for a song, not see it there, transfer it to the device, and then go back to Poweramp and the formerly empty search field would show the song I just transfered, no memory lagg or freeze up. The music library was even available between every app on the phone.But then when Poweramp decided to make its own music library, I understand there were some benefits to initial scan times, and multiple sd cards, but the headache just isnt worth it for a lot of us. Would you all consider giving us the option to at least use the system library instead of Poweramps custom library? Please and pretty please, I beg you. I am a DJ, and as one passionate about my craft I do my best to have my phone equipped with solid playlists to pull from for any given moment in life where a good soundtrack is needed. There have been a ton of really great moments with this app#33; Your apps queue, search, playlists, crossfarder, and ui are unmatched in this regard#33; In a pinch I can dj off this app, and thats saying something. But the sad part is I have wasted COUNTLESS HOURS rebuilding my wonderful playlists. Yesterday I tried again, and exported the playlist after adding 140 songs to it. Then today after adding new songs to the device a rescan was triggered, bye bye went my playlist. I was left with 58 songs in the playlist, and an incomplete library, which required another rescan. I can see the playlists I exported in the playlist directory, but why doesnt Poweramp import them when I select import playlists?Do you see how frustrating this is? Yesterday I even began using Winamp#33;#33; Its just faithful.. but the UI is much worse and I went back to Poweramp only to find this happen. It seems arrogant of you guys, that you give users the option to disable the system library, but you dont give us the option to choose which library we like better. Please, let us choose.	option,playlists,library	08 August 2012 - 02:25 PM	Tristan	[Poweramp library contains formats not possible in stock library, and stock library has a lot of bugs by itself - Poweramp v1.0 had it and number of non-fixable issues was 10x of what we have now. As for playlists, there is a simple rule - when Poweramp cant access song (because it doesnt exist on its place where Poweramp registered it last time) - it wont be visible in custom playlistqueue. File based playlists have no such issue (as songs are found by their names), and we have plans to move Poweramp to file based playlists completely. Thanks#33;];[I never experienced any problems with Poweramp when it ran off the system library. Maybe thats just the luck of my Galaxy S. Why cant it be at least an option to use the system library? You give us the option to disable it. The option to disable Poweramps library, and stick with the system library, might just work better for some of us. Especially when building playlists in Winamp on my pc and then syncing them to the phone, they automatically show up in the system library but not Poweramp. More time spent importing.. etc.];[Oh and the location of my songs never changed, but for some reason when Poweramp rescans it loses a lot of songs out of the playlists.];[Just thought I should let you guys know that as I was sleeping Poweramp somehow took a file based playlist from 140 songs to 6. All without the files going anywhere. Please help];[People have solved this issue, for now, by simply turning off the library auto rescan and manually scanning when they have new music on their device.];
resume music on atrix car dock	Hello all, I am a happy owner of a Motorola Atrix ME860 and a true enthusiast of Poweramp. I have been using the official Car Dock for a few weeks, and there is one thing I miss from the player, and its the possibility to resume music when connected to the car dock. I know there is the option to resume the music when connecting an audio jack or when connecting to bluetooth. But the Motorola Atrix Car Dock only has a Micro USB connector which automatically launches the Cardock app. Even though it can be configured to have the different apps on the main screen, having to open Poweramp manually and pressing play afterwards is too much for me (Im a lazy person). Could it be possible to include an option to AUTO Resume or Auto Play when inserting into the Car dock?? This option would be fantastic#33; Thank you	cardock,option,resume,auto,car,dock	13 August 2012 - 09:41 AM	Bolex	[Also, I forgot to mention that auto-pausing the music or even auto closing the app when removing from the car dock would be good to have.

support sort artist and sort album artist tags for sorting	iTunes supports these tags which it uses to sort Artists and Album Artists. That lets you sort an artist like quot;Sage Francisquot; by last name, under F, where he should be. So, great to have the option to use such tags for sorting.	sort,tag,album artist,artist	11 August 2012 - 04:14 AM	mkosma	[Also, it would be really nice if I could sort my music in album view for example by artist and then by date, not alphabetically like it is now by default.];
play queue should not obey list tap rule	The tap on a song rules should be differentiated for the play queue and lists. If I have it set up to add a song from a listthe library to the play queue when I tap it, it is highly unlikely that when I tap the song in the play queue that I want to add it to the play queue again. The play queue should act as a current playlist, where a tap = play now, not a list of songs.	tap,play,queue,list,playlist	09 August 2012 - 11:57 AM	ed.j	[So you want it that Poweramp shouldnt give you the option to place a song in the queue list when youre already looking at your queue list? Am I getting that right?];
lyrics - small and big improvementsadditions	- ogg lyrics tags support (.ogg, .flac) - id3v1 or id3v2 (at least one is not supported) - timestamped lyrics support (aka .lrc): no matter Poweramp will add synchronous autoscroll or not (which of course would also be very welcomed), at least should clean up the timestamps and show scrollable static lyrics. - font size setting (already requested somewhere else) - THE LYRICS PANEL: I would love to have an option to automatically show lyrics, And another option to whether show lyrics over album art or totally disable album art so lyrics are shown over black background. I do not like at all having to go to menu to access lyrics. I would like lyrics to be integrated in the player interface, so that one can navigate the song and the lyrics simultaneously (i m afraid this has changed in the wrong direction with Poweramp 2.0) The big addition would be to have the ability to long press on lyrics to select text for copying it to clipboard or export it to a dictionary like Fora Dictionary (they have an api already used by other apps like FBreader). IMO this is one of the two big areas where Poweramp could improve a lot (the other one is Headset Control) Hope this comments are useful.

I can see why your lyrics commercial partners may not want Poweramp to retrieve lyrics from free online services.

So what I am requesting is to extend lyrics support to OGGFLAC tags, as well as id3v1 + id3v2. Poweramp can show that flac files have on their tags, but for some reason it skips showing the LYRICS field. Now the other issue is that people want lyrics to be shown automatically. That is pretty straightforward to do with embedded lyrics (as Poweramp v1 was doing), but seems not so easy with commercial lyrics providers.Is it too much to ask that Poweramp can show embedded lyrics automatically and also allow searching for lyrics though commercial lyrics partners (the latter involving starting another app)?

Thiere is obviously NO legal reason that this cant be one (heck, Apple does this), and no other music player does this correctly right now, so it would be a huge selling feature.

Most android phones come with an universal 3.5 mm TRS audio jack by the way, so you can easily upgrade your sound you know? its up to you to stay with those crappy earbuds of yours.

advanced random song options: supermix	I have a good amount of songs, and a good amount of entire albums. So Ive taken advantage of the quot;shuffle all available songsquot; option ALMOST all the time now. The following may be a bit hefty, but having these features attached to the quot;shuffle all available songsquot; option would be super rad: Some songs are attached to the ones that follow, like intro songs that blend into the next track or quot;We Will Rock Youquot; followed by quot;We Are The Championsquot; by Queen, and so on. Have the option to attach these songs, i have some intro songs that last 30 seconds before the main song, and playing those by themselves along with other random songs is kinda weird. Make it possible to isolate the quot;fadecrossfade the beginningend of trackquot; option to the quot;shuffle all available songsquot; option. Only because from time to time I do play whole albums on the go. Itd be great if I wouldnt have to switch off then back on that fade option every time I transition from shuffle to album sets. And because I switch from a shuffle set to an album and back to shuffle, I notice that I hear some of the same songs from previous shuffle plays, have some sort of restriction to the artist or song so that we do not hear it again within a given period. This counts for multiples of the same song, for instance, I have studio and live versions of some songsalbums. Create specific shuffle sets according to genre. Because playing a quot;Jack Johnsonquot; song followed by quot;M#246;torheadquot; followed by quot;UB40quot; followed by quot;Pearl Jamquot; doesnt make much sense. Just rename quot;shuffle all available songsquot; to quot;Supermixquot; or something to distinguish that this is a sub feature that no one else ha Of course only the hard core music listeners like myself would care for such a feature.	random,shuffle,option	03 August 2012 - 11:25 PM	mynameisj

option to completely exit poweramp	Unless im missing it, I think there should be an option to close the program so I dont have to do it manually in androids task manager.	close,exit	31 July 2012 - 07:40 PM	hlzbelliz	[Theres really no reason to manually kill it. Android isnt set up like Windows or OS-X in terms of memory management. When you quot;minimizequot; an Android app, as long as that app doesnt have an active task, it will quot;freezequot; and essentially stop using the CPU. It remains in memory so it can be quot;unfrozenquot; instantly when you want to use it again, and if the system needs memory for a new app, it finds the background app thats been inactive the longest and kills it to free the space. Task killers are useful ONLY as a fast way to kill STUCK applications. Android gains no performance benefit from having 200mb of free ram vs. 100mb, and having to hit internal memory and move apps into RAM every single time you want to use them is more of a battery drain than simply reading whats already in RAM again.];
192khz file support	Hi, Id like to see support for 192 kHz flac or wavpack files. while quality wise theres not really the need for it on a non highend system, the purpose is mainly a matter of convenience, as you would not have to resample amp; dither down your 192 kHz music files any more before being able to listen to those via your smartphone. really saves quite a bit of time and hassle, you could simply copy everything over. thanks, Thunderbolt	wv,format,flac	07 January 2012 - 02:16 PM	Thunderbolt	[Hi everyone, just discovered that my wonderful Poweramp doesnt play 192Khz24bit Testcase:https:www.hdtracks...=HX794043160493 I understand that It may not be so important, but I think it could be useful just not to have it converted (or at least say clearly that there is not 192Khz24bit support at the moment) Thanks a lot.];[What version of Poweramp are you using?];[Hi, Im running Poweramp 2.0.6-build-508 Full Version on Samsung Galaxy S III International (Exynos Quad SOC), everything stock, no root.The error is quot;File execution failedquot;.];[Could I ask why you would like to have such a file? I find it interesting because I dont think most phones audio chips are actually even good enough to handle 16bit44.1khz audio with any level of decency... for one, a lossy-encoded file sounds way better (less muddy, more neutral in tone) on an desktop onboard than my HTC One X... Though I would concede that in all likelihood its just that the HTC One X probably just has a very bad audio chipset... how about other makes? (Perhaps Im digressing too much if the mods think this warrants a new thread, so be it...)];
more shuffle options	What I really want from Poweramp is the ability to shuffle all songs by pressing the small skip button, but to go to the next song on the album if the skip button right next to the play button is pressed. As of right now I cant get power amp to behave this way. Is there anyway to make this an addition to the program? Overall an excellent program just wished there was a way to do that.	skip,button,shuffle	26 July 2012 - 08:51 PM	BrianH	
customize buttons in notification tray	Hi, In a recent update, an X button to close the player was added in the notification tray line, and to me its useless. Currently there is an option to enable or disable the prev track button, but I dont think thats enough. It would be better to have a full options screen where we can choose which buttons to show. On a related note, in my opinion the buttons are too small. They can be made wider (and take up more space from the song text). Maybe make the button width a part of the customization dialog?	customize,notification,options,button	24 July 2012 - 12:21 PM	KleptoMan	[For buttons being too small, you mean the notification bar or the player? And the button was added there so that when you pause your music, Poweramp tray can still stay there until you want to resume. People requested that, so we had to add it that way.];[1. I meant the buttons in the notification. 2. It can still be made a configurable option (keep Poweramp in tray on pause) along with selecting which buttons appear 3. you reminded me of a nitpick I have about buttons in the main player window too. In landscape mode, the fwdback buttons are both located on the right, one above the other. I think back should be at the left of the screen, and fwd at the right. Its a bit confusing the way it is now. There is much more space in landscape mode, why use less of it for buttons?];
batch transfer	I was surprised to see that there seems to be no option for batch transfer of music over Bluetooth or related service. It is a pain when one tries to transfer whole albums over Bluetooth. This feature should definitely be included. One should be able to select multiple tracks or even albums and transfer them long press menus for albums should be included for album transfer. Playlists and ques should also be transferable.

tracknumbers displayed in album lists	Dear Poweramp Team. Great app. I would use it all the time, if only one little feature could be added. To show tracknumbers in album lists. Winamp can do this, but there are other problems with Winamp that makes me prefer Poweramp. When I go into the library section I can choose, amongst other things: Albums When I choose albums I see all albums listed in alfabetical order, with information about the artist and the total number of songs the album contains. So far GREAT#33; Then when I go into a particular album, I can see all songs with the title, the artist, the length of the song and album name. It would be great if the tracknumber was displayed also.

export playcount	Thank you for a great product. But I have a feature request. I use MediaMonkey as my music manager, and use it to sync my music to my Android phone. And I love using Poweramp, but I dont like that there is no way for my play count to be synced back to my MediaMonkey database. That is, I would love for MediaMonkey to reflect a play for songs that I listen to with Poweramp, after I sync it back to my MediaMonkey. The beauty of MediaMonkey is the ability to customize it with scripts. There is one MM user that has written a script that will update the playcount for songs played on the Android after syncing it with MM. All that is needed is for the Android music player to generate a file that contains play count, album, artist, title, etc. He wrote the script to work with the Android player called PlayerPro since they have that feature built in. Is there anyway that Poweramp can implement this feature?

shoutcaststreaming web radio	I just purchased the Poweramp app today, after reccomendations from my friends. Its a great app, but ive also just reinstalled Winamp Pro. Id love to make Poweramp my one app for all music on my phone, but I cant. It doesnt stream web radio - with Poweramps ability to play almost any local file, it would be great to see it integrate support for streaming Windows Media, MP3, RealMedia as well as AAC streams - no other app does all this at the moment. Winamps major limitation with shoutcaststreaming is its inability to stream AAC+ which means i also need Tune In Radio installed on the phone. I understand that must sound like a lot of work for your developers - however - as an alternative, perhaps it would be easier to partner with someone like Tune In so that in their next update Tune In users will be able to use the Graphic EQ and other effects of Poweramp? (perhaps DISky could join in on that party too) That would be awesome#33; Infact why cant all sound played on the phone be routed through Poweramp?

poweramp album art quality	Hello everyone, this is my first time posting here. (Yes, I have shamelessy created an account specifically to create this thread.)Well, first off, I do not know if this thread is in the right section, but if it isnt, can someone direct me to the correct forum section?Second, I do not know if this has already been asked before, hence I apologise in advance if I am rehashing the same question again. (I have tried to google for this issue, but it seems as though no one has actually made this request... so yeah.)Alright, now thats aside, my request is......is it possible to implement a custom internal album art scaling feature? To my knowledge, Poweramp apparently internally scales album art pictures to a resolution of 512 x 512.Phones these days are sporting average resolutions of 1280 x 720, and I feel as though the old preset scaling is no longer sufficient enough to properly display album art images sharply on modern devices.Ah yes, for the record, my album art images, to begin with are on average, 1280 x 1280. I use a Galaxy Note GT-7000.The post in which I obtained my information from: http:forum.poweram...1978-album-artThe quote: I hope that this feature isnt too hard to implement (or is it even possible?)Can it even be considered, actually?In anycase, sorry for this excessively long post, and thank you for reading.	internal,scaling,display,album art	23 June 2012 - 09:26 AM	Kiritsugu	[An option to customize the default scaling would definitely be welcome.

improve quality of the album art displayed in the player screen	More often than not there are noticeable resizing artifacts on the album art displayed in the Player screen. Itd be nice if it had a smoother, quot;properly resizedquot; look. Other than that, Im absolutely loving Poweramp#33;	player,screen,display,now playing,album art	04 April 2012 - 03:15 AM	zamuz	[I second this. As the screen sizes and resolution increases on these new phones, a lof of times, the image quality of the album art pulled by Poweramp is sub-par at best. Many of them are low res images, let alone HD quality images. If I may suggest, do something similar with PlayerPro, where we can choose album arts based on resolution and file size. Also, it will be much better if our choices are not limited to only 6 results per search, since sometimes, those are not even sufficient. To be honest, I am too fond with how version 2 deals with album art. I still like how version 1 handled it. I understand you wish to make those album arts look bigger and cooler. However, almost all album arts dont fit the space provided properly and ends up getting cropped. And to fill the space requires zooming, which further distorts image quality, especially if they are not HD. And my biggest issue with version 2, is those colorful replication of the edges of the album art to cover the background behind the album art. I cannot stand that since most of the time the colors look horrible. Please, if it is a task to somehow pull HD quality artworks, then at least provide the options of disabling those colorful backgrounds, or maybe even include the original version 1 skin as part of the theme selections. One suggestion, why not somewhat mimic what pandora does and just have a reflection of the album art at the bottom. There are many better ways of dealing with the album art than zooming them or having bands of distorted colors to fill the background. Thanks.

better bluetooth headset priority controls	Hey there, Ive been running into a major annoyance with Poweramp Pro lately. I mostly use Poweramp to listen to audio books, and using XiiaLive for listening to web radios. Problem is, Poweramp is way too aggressive with picking up commands from my bluetooth headset. As soon as I press play, regardless of whether Ive used Poweramp since turning on my phone or not, Poweramp starts playing. It even does this is XiiaLive (or Audio book player, or any other app) is currently in focus. This is quite annoying, and looking at the options menu the only two options are to disable bluetooth altogether, or to increase priority? What would that even do? =) Anyway, preferably I would like Poweramp to respond to my bluetooth if:It is currently in focusIt is currently playing a fileIt is told to play within a short time, say half a minute, after pausingThe widget is currently visibleThis would really heighten my user experience. Finally, if this is some kind of bug, herere my specs: Phone: Galaxy NexusAndroid version: 4.02 (vanilla, rooted)Headset: MW600Poweramp version: 2.06-build-507 Full versionAnd using the Poweramp widget, 4 tiles wide, 1 high.

adding volume bar on the lockscreen	Hey I think would be good to add a simple sound icon somewhere on the lockscreen for quick volume change.

dancing equalizer option instead of album art. great for car dock#33;	Love, love love Power Amp. With that out of the way I have to say that I really like using my car dock and nothing more would make listening to my music on with Power Amp better than a dancing equalizer visualization. It would go along with your music and It would make a really great feature that would make the separation from the competitors even further than it already is. It could be an option instead of album art or maybe it can be transparent over the album art (Idk). It could be a paid feature that I think a lot of people would buy.

[ics htc] 3-dot removal?	Hi, I have purchased and used Poweramp for around a year now. Just recently I switched an htc one xl with sense 4.0 and ics. On the one x, Poweramp seem to be running in compatible mode which is the old interface (screen ratio, etc) with the 3-dot option bar at the bottom.

automatic stopresume while leavingentering the car dock (or car mode)	Hi there Im using Power Amp mainly in my car (Samsung Galaxy SII) with the AUX enabled car dock. Would it be possible to add aditional option to automatically Stop playing the music when leaving the car dock (or car mode) - and resume once in - the same way as disconecting the headset options are set. I was using AutomateIt and custom app to sent the STOP key via BT Keys while leaving the car dock, and it was usually working fine, although after the upgrade to ICS 4.0.3 BT Control Keys stopped functioning at all, and its kind of frustrating when the phone starts to shout via the speaker when Im taking it out of the dock.

library profile	Hi there, I thought that maybe another suggestion might take place. This feature request targeted to solve the same problem as in post http:forum.poweram...dpostp11776 Thank you for wonderful player with great sound. I listen to lossless (flac and ape) rips from cd and vinyl and found quality of sound very true. In my local home library more 1000 albums in about 500 Gb. The most of it is jazz, a lot of good old rock, some classics and blues. Its impossible to copy all my collection to my galaxy tab even if use 64 gb SD card. So, I mounted cifs and listen to the most my collection over wi-fi (thanks to wolfson DAC on SGT, etymotics ER-4 and of course Poweramp - sound very nice). There is an issue to enjoy the music. After disconnecting local library source (shut down desctop, turn off wi-fi, whatever) Poweramp loosing all media in cifs folder except the ones it has on sdcard. It happens even cifs wasnt unmounted. For instance TTPOD keeps media from cifs even if source down or device used away, playing only media from sdcard. Rescan library take 5-8 minutes and make device unusable at the moment - nothing actually work when scan running. I think maybe adding profiles (for instance - quot;Home libraryquot;, quot;Work libraryquot;, quot;Going Out libraryquot;, etc) would be great. In such profiles add ability to choose different folder. Such profile would help to easily use the Poweramp in different situation and significantly reduce scan time. Hope you find this reasonable.

feature: playing summary	Max, thanks for your GREAT app. It would be nice if Poweramp had a tool to manager our library and preferences, some kind of Playing Summary, where it would show users playing preferences info, such as what music you listened most, what song you skipped most (i.e if you skipped that song while it was 10 played ok, but if you skipped that song while its 90 played, Poweramp would assume you listened it in full length. Also, Summary would show what EQ you most used, the time you most used to listen to music (morning, afternoon, etc) This feature would helps user to manager your songs library, to improve your EQ experience, and even to help you to monitor your battery usage.

bluetooth sound enhance solution?	Hi Power AMP team: I tried the my phone (HTC Sensation) with my Poweramp (full ver2.0.5) and play music on my car by Bluetooth. However the sound quality is not good as earphone and easy to have distortion.

I would very happy if any solutions.	sound,car use,bluetooth	23 May 2012 - 07:06 AM	agw0121	[Well Poweramp does change the music you listen to a whole lot when you listen to it from your headphones but here is what happens. Headphones can handle a whole lot more information than wireless can (why WiFi can never be as fast as wired internet). So: 1) Thats inevitable 2) Yeah, because of the first point... it puts out too much information for bluetooth to handle. The only think you can do is turn up your bluetooths settings to max (bass, treble) then put Poweramp to flat. When you put too much information out for bluetooth, itll cost distortion. 3)Beats wont work because it puts out way too much information for bluetooth to transfer 4) The limit button, in my opinion, is probable the only way you can go about listening to music wirelessly. I use it always even with headphones (beats by dre studio), and think it makes my music not too high on bass or treble. All it does is make the high and low limited to what really sounds good and clean on headphonesspeakersbluetooth devices. with that all said, we will try to make a pre-set in the equalizer drop down for bluetooth or something to optimize playback over bluetooth.

per channel eq	There was one big reason I bought this application: FLAC support. That its an excellent player is just a plus. There is one feature Id like though: The ability to perform per-channel equalization. This would be great because, as with FLAC, it vastly improves the listening experience for my music. Personally, I hear differently in either ear, in my left ear, I hear poorly in the midlow frequency range. This is true for many people, although for me its quite pronounced. When I listen with headphones this is particularly noticeable, and it would be great to mix either channel differently to compromise for the pair of ears Ive got on my head. The current, mono equaliser is handy for compromising for the response my my headphones, perhaps the best thing would be to make it possible to switch between a mono or a stereo equalizer? The other option would be to have a 3 stage equaliser: left, right, and master. Another good reason is that many albums are mixed with different instrumentation on either channel, and require different mixing to sound their best. This is the only feature Id really like, thought Id throw it out there. Regards, Liam	equaliser,option	26 May 2012 - 05:00 AM	LiamM

album cover : allow to change keywords	Hi #33; Id like to be able to change the keywords used to search for the album cover, or allow to search for more results. Sometimes, it doesnt correctly select the cover of the current playing song, so a long press on the cover starts searching for other covers. In most cases it works quite well. But sometimes it fails : - for customrare compilations where the quot;albumquot; field of the MP3 tag is not the official album of the song but a different name. - The band album is not well known or looks like an existing name more popupar (the french band quot;Dollyquot; always give me Dolly Parton covers) - The album name contains a lot of information (year, volume number, etc.) that I think might prevent the search to return correct results. So it would be nice if a long press on the search keywords (usually band - album name) in the search screen could allow the user to alter them in order to improve the accuracy of the search. Another good solution would be to allow the user to search for more covers. Today the search returns only a few results. At the bottom of the screen, a quot;morequot; button could help to find an appropriate cover. Thanks #33;	album,keyword,search,cover	16 May 2012 - 03:04 PM	killergege

This is low-hanging fruit surely? - a list cant be that difficult, compared to gapless playback and the other great stuff that Poweramp does? Also, import all the album art from WMP12 and use it for thumbnails as well as full screen display.

is poweramp playback of flac alac files a compressed sound?	Hello, I am trying out the Poweramp player with my Acer tablet (A200) with Android Ice Cream Sandwich OS (4.0.3) prior to purchase. It looks excellent so far. First question: when using Poweramp to playback music files that are in FLAC or ALAC (i.e., uncompressed), does Poweramp compress the sound for playback? The reason I ask is I see the new Android native music player, Google Play Music, will play FLAC files but in doing so will take these unompressed, highest quality files, and compress the sound down to a 320 bit rate or lower. Would like to know if your Poweramp does the same thing. Second question: I had trouble with Google Play Music recognizing and playing about 50GB of music on a 64GB USB flash drive. Poweramp, so far, seems to work well witth my usb flash drive. Ive tried disconnecting the drive, then its music does not appear in the Poweramp library. When I re-connect the usb drive, then Poweramp will scan it again and then I can see and play its music. Is there anything extra I need to do when disconnecting and reconnecting this flash drive, such as clear data or clear cache? Thanks.

visualizations?	Is there a chance that there will ever be visuals for displays? I know its not common as on a phone tablet, you wouldnt want the screen on all the time. But when theyre on a cradle or on charge, it would be a cool thing. I loved it on WinAmp with my PC and Laptop, so yeah, would be kind of cool here too.

ignore repeat - queue	Hello, Is there a chance that you can add an option to Ignore Repeat to queues (similar to the Ignore Shuffle option)?

visualization features	Dear Developers, thank you for Poweramp, its great. I would like to request for a Level Meter Visualization Feature (Stereo). And if possible, Spektrum Analyzer and Osziloscope Views - in stereo, but the channels in overlay, market by own color. These Things may be quite useless for playing mp3 Files. But we started hearing Music with Tapes, and we enjoyed the Level Meters of them. I know that this is very hard to manage on a handy display and uses much battery power. But it should only be an option.

exclude folders if .nomedia file exists	The Poweramp is smart and fast to scan the music folders on sdcard. But it can find non-music as well, like the ringtone or the game sound. Though I can change the Music Folders in setting, I perfer the program do not contain the folders within .nomedia file. And I can manually add the .nomedia file to those folders I dont want to be scanned by Poweramp. Then Ill do the Auto-FindFull-Rescan.

album art browser similar to playerpro	Hi, I am thankful to the devs for the 1.99 sale for Poweramp. It was an excellent price for the app and Poweramp is the only app which works flawlessly on my Atrix 4g on which any music player is supercrappy. This is my first purchase on android market and I am happy. A few feature requests for further versions: 1. Album art browser similar to Playerpro...only better...This will help in finding images for songs for which no images are found through ID3 tags e.g. old folk songs etc. 2.

It seems like as you force Poweramp to shut down, it is unable to save the previous state (or it corrupts it).Poweramp doesnt have the option to quot;shut offquot;, however it automatically unloads the process and turns itself off when you are not playing any music, so to turn it off you just have to pausestop the playback and exit the app with the tap on the homr button. If you still experience this issue without using the task killer, try clearing the data and cache. Theres been a rather big debate whether to or not to use task killers in the past and since at least Android 2.2 and up, they simply are unnecessary. The idea of freeing up ram is not working very good with the way Android (and the entire Linux base) is made as it has a much different memory handling compared to Windows. The memory handling in Android defeats the purpose of using a task killer... theres a reason that Google removed the ability to use task killer automatically with 2.2.The reason I tell you to consider not using a task killer is because it interferes with Androids built in memory handling and it has the risk of causing issues with the apps you quot;killquot;.];[Agreed, with recent Android releases task killers are not much help (and indeed can be counter-productive). Just let the OS handle loading and unloading apps. Andre];[You need to let Poweramp at least one time to finishunload normally (it unloads in 5 seconds when paused and no Poweramp activities on the screen exist). Otherwise task killers dont give a chance to save settings, including state of the already shown hints. Thanks#33;];
display id3 instead of album art	Hi. Sorry if this has been posted, but the forum search wont allow searches for 3-letter words like quot;ID3quot; or quot;Artquot;. I use my android in my car and plug it into my stereo. I have a holder for my android - the suction cup attached to the windshield (much like most GPS units). Anyway, is there a way to have Poweramp show the ID3 info (Artist, Album and Track Name) instead of the Album Art? As it is now, the ID3 info shows in the lower left corner, but the text is so tiny I cant really read it. Id much rather have it display the ID3 info than the Album Art.

disabling lockscreen buttons	Hi, Im quite satisfied with using Poweramp, but I think theres quite big issue on lockscreen. Its possible to disable lockscreen gestures, what is good feature, but not as important as disabling some lockscreen buttons - it isnt too probable to do swipe gesture accidentally, however some button is pressed quite often by mistake, when carrying phone in pocket.

smarter list scrolling	Hi everybody, I really dont like how the scrolling bar works... Let me explain: when I scroll down the Artist list, the first 13 is reserved to numbers, letter A starts from about 13 on. And, in my 30GB music library, I dont have any artists name starting with a number . More than one drawbak in my opinion: list stuck for the first part (the part reserved to numbers), all the rest more squeezed (this makes precise search more difficult). Moreover, the list bumps when you switch scrolling between swiping the finger up-down and using the bar. On SGS, tested both with Android 2.3.x and 4.0.

more changeable settings for playback during call	Hello, sorry if this has been posted before. I have been using Poweramp for several months now and I am very pleased with the app as a whole. As updates come out, functionality is improved. There is however, one little thing that I would like to see in a future update. Playback is possible during calls, which to me is extremely vital. I am constantly on the phone at work and like to have music too. Everything works well but I think to make things just a little bit better would be the ability to have some settings implemented: #8226; Ability to toggle Poweramp to NOT pauseplay with incoming or ended calls: if music is playing, it will continue to play regardless of call activity, until I actually pause it. #8226; Ability to toggle Poweramp to NOT have different playback volumes for on-a-call vs not-on-a-call: as of now playback is louder while on a call and softer when not, causing me to have to adjust the volume fairly often. To implement these two things would make an enormous amount of difference, and while some users may actually prefer the settings status quo, I feel that having the ability to adjust the settings will make the app more customizable and attractive to a wider audience.	phone,playback,setting,call,volume	17 February 2012 - 08:51 PM	alasdairvfr	[I believe at least the first already exists in Menu gt; Settings gt; Audio Engine gt; Audio Focus Change];[This doesnt seem to prevent pausing with a new call. To pause when its ringing is one thing, but playback does not resume once connection is established.];[Thanks for the request, its easy to add option not to pause on calls. As for resume after the call, Poweramp does this. If it doesnt happen it can mean one of the following: - call end event is not reaching Poweramp (due to the rom issues, other app interference) - something immediately sends extra events (headset related). Can be checked by temporarily disabling Headset controls option in Poweramp.];[Excellent, I very much hope to see this implemented soon.

In the latter case - if i didnt overlook something - two options would be sufficient: 1. quot;use itunescompilationflagquot; (for iTunes user), 2. quot;Use TPE2-Frame for MP3squot; (for Winamp, WMP, Media Monkey, etc. users). Furthermore Poweramp should have an internalhardcoded list of possible names of frame headers (TXXX-Frames in ID3v2, Vorbis Comment, Ape) for identification: i think quot;Album Artistquot; and quot;Albumartistquot; would be enough.];
.lrc support	Hi there, I bought Poweramp recently and found it really amazing. but theres only one thing that can improve, thats the lyrics(.lrc) support. Poweramp it self can support embedded id3 lyrics, but it doesnt support lyrics in lrc format. Usually, when enjoying music, i wish to download the lyrics and display it to learn the song. this can be easily done in computer. but not for android phones. there are many apps in China like ttpod, that do such job. but i really love Poweramp. I think it will be greater if Poweramp has such feature. Will you guys think about this? Thanks#33;	download,display,lyrics	03 January 2012 - 10:32 AM	gangzhou01	[we need this feature];

copying multiple mp3 files to a playlist	Hello, I have 876 MP3s on my Driod R2D2, I copied ALL to specific playlist, (1971, 1975, 1990...etc) I had 8 playlist each a specific year. This took a few hours copying one at a time. Now I had to replace my driod and re-installed my licenced copy of Poweramp and have to do it all over again. My question is: Is there a way to tag multiple files to copy to a playlist or do I have to move EVERYONE one at a time again?Daniel	playlist,tag,multiple files	25 January 2012 - 10:28 PM	DCRoach95	[If the specific year is embedded into the tags of each mp3 you could fire up MediaMonkey on your library and pull up a list of all of your songs sorted by year.

Then open up the M3U file using notepad and remove the drive letter and path UP TO THE ROOT FOLDER for each file listed.

separate volume levels (headset vs. phone)	I would really like it if Poweramp kept separate volume settings like iPods do (for headsets vs. built-in speakers).

non-visual navigation - true subsitute for hardware keys	I find Poweramp the only player capable (without glitches or lack of basic functions) of providing navigation without the need to look on the screen - music is for listening, not watching. Im talking about lockscreen and its swipe navigation. Hovewer it needs polishing - 2 additional features: 1. swipe to move seek bar - inside as song: I would consider adding an option for that and implement it by aplying the same geasture as for swipe-to-move-to-the-next-track but with keeping pressing after swipe. Of course any other clever geasture would suffice 2. option to removeblock other ways of navigation - software buttons on the screen (its only a source of problems if you dont look on the screen) PS: of course hardware keys navigation is better but who can provide that.	hardware,touch,navigation	08 January 2012 - 02:04 PM	powerampmc

Another option would be volume updown on swiping updown... Of course, everyone wants to have it differently so why not making it customizable in the settings?

poweramp conflicts with volume+ and other system equalizers	Hi, Ive got a Galaxy Nexus, and I love Poweramp, since its the only player ive seen which doesnt stutter while the screen is off by using the audio buffer. HOWEVER, Ive noticed that once I start playing a song with it, it cancels out Volume+ and Equalizer, and other apps that do similar things. This is a big thing for me because the Galaxy Nexus has very poor speaker volume for notifications and ringing, but with music playing over Poweramp it comes out VERY loud. I was wondering if there was a possiblity to have the Equalizer for Poweramp apply to the whole system via the quot;Music Effectsquot; option in sound options. Or have Poweramp not cancel it out completely.	volume,equalizer	28 December 2011 - 10:24 AM	Bisazz	
top rated search search by stars	Hello, Top rated feature allows me to see a song with 5 stars, but I think that it is not enough. When I choose the search option, I can imagine to type stars as mark how rated songs I am looking for. If the search text contained only stars or + sign, then it could search songs with a particular rating. For example: quot;***+quot; expression would results evaluation of *** or **** or ***** Search quot;****quot; (4 *) to find a song with a 4 star rating, not more, not less (exact expression). Can also be possible to give stars rating to whole albums and sort them by rating, and then alphabetically in lists? It could give me some favorite sorting on first look.

override android volume with better volume	I dont know if all Android devices are the same, but my Archos 43 has a pretty bad volume control. In particular, theres this one point near the top where Id swear it jumps at least 6dB with one button press and I want it to only go up about 3dB. Theres just no accuracy in the upper volume range at all and no matter how hard I try I just cant quite get it right. The best Ive been able to do so far is MP3Gain process all of my music to a weird number, and then slightly adjust ReplayGain in Poweramp to get it just a bit closer to something that comes out about right at those volume levels. What Id really love to see though is if ReplayGain could just override the device controls. Basically, just have the device use full volume (I know programs can do this because I have one game that sometimes does it even) and then take over the volume control buttons with your own software volume control with much more accuracy and control instead. The resulting control would be more accurate and generally better for everyone I think.	volume,button	25 December 2011 - 08:23 PM	Nazo

pause music on carkit bt disconnect	Hi, I use audible.com to listen to books in the car, and one thing I really enjoy about that app being used in the car is that when I turn off my car, the app automatically pauses the book. I learned that it did this not by sensing when power was removed which I thought at first was how it was doing it, but instead that it did it based on my car kits audio headset disconnection.

a manual file browser (as an on-the-fly alternative to scanning)	Hi, Is anyone privy to the idea of PowerMP having its own manual File Explorer? A File Explorer would simply be afile-manager-like feature that would be accessible from within PowerMPs folders screen and would allow for manual file browsing of the whole of a users Android system (just like a file-manager) except that this File Explorer within PowerMP would be heavily cut-down in file-manager features and would also be auto-filtered to only recognize Media file-extensions (audiovideo and playlist files) and no others...Perhaps with user settings to configure what file-extensions are filtered .ogg, .mp3, .m4a etc So if a song is opened from an external file-manager like ASTRO, into PowerMP then upon clicking on song info the user would be taken to this proposed File Explorer view (Folders screen, not Library screen). Also a PowerMP manual File Explorer could support quot;Lazy loadingquot; of files i.e. files loaded in a folder slowly appear and not fast-scanned conventionally. Many video players apps (ffmpeg ones) on Android offer their own File Explorer most notably MoboPlayer and RockPlayer.

I.e. allany folders of the phonesdcard like a standard Android file browser, regardless if the foldersfiles are in the PowerMP Library or not.

support for bluetooth devices having an amplifier	One feature I think would be fantastic is to better support bluetooth devices such as car radios which already have an amplifier and equalizer. When paired with a bluetooth device which has a built-in amp, it would be great for Poweramp to output a flat non-preamped signal over bluetooth. This way, amp volume, bass boost and various equalizer settings can be controlled only by the external device. However, when not paired to a bluetooth device which has its own amp and equalizer, the Poweramp equalizer and volume controls would be used. As always, when wired ear budsheadphones are used, Poweramp controls everything. If this is already an existing feature, my apologies but Ive not been able to figure out how to do this.

Currently, PA doest sync back changes made to the quot;file based playlistsquot;: http:forum.poweram...ndpostp6977http:forum.poweram...ndpostp6983];[Well...Ive got some news...PA does save changes to .m3u files...whether you know this or not Ive seen the message quot;playlist.m3u has been savedquot; appear for a few seconds in blue font at the bottom of the list page of playlists when exiting a particular .m3u file based playlist. So, Ive been trying to repeat this save method for over a week now until today I figured it out. Ive tested it and 100 of my results reveal the message quot;.m3u playlist is savedquot;. I even opened the .m3u file on my PC with Windows Media Player and the saved changes are clearly there. I now have a full .m3u file based playlist editor...#33;#33;#33; Also, Ive already tried the Settings gt;gt; Advanced gt;gt; Playlists ImportExport to get the file based playlists exported (i.e. backed-up) as .m3u8 files as you suggested but I always get quot;0 playlists exportedquot; and yes, Ive checked Ive got a quot;playlistsquot; folder for PA to write to. Ive gone as far as to create a folder in both phone and external sd card just in case. I made sure they are selected in folder scans, re-scanned, killed the app, re-booted the phone, re-scanned...yada yada...but export doesnt work for me on my Samsung Galaxy S2 (Bell Mobility) running OS 2.3 and a fully licensed PA 2.0.1-build 455.

Probably this should be indicated more clearly in the settings (or also some option to export everything can be added later).];[FYI...save only occurs when you : 1. change the order of at least one song, and 2. exit the playlist Booyaka...#33;#33;#33; Enjoy ful edit amp; save capabilities of .m3u playlist];[If my playlists get erased for some reason how do I get them back without having to resave them all?];[Library playlist or file-based playlist ??];[I dont really know the difference between the two. I save a playlist on Poweramp by long-pressing an artist name and then specifying which playlist those songs should be saved in. My music is all on my SD card but when I export those playlists they export to a quot;Playlistsquot; folder on the phone hard drive as .m3u8 files. Normally, when I connect my phone via USB I lose all my Winamp and Playerpro playlists but my Poweramp playlists remain. Yesterday, I connected my phone via USB to make changes directly to the mp3 tags and all of my Poweramp playlists were gone. The playlist quot;locationsquot; in that it showed artist names when I clicked quot;Playlistsquot; from the main menu but the playlists were empty. If that happens, what do I do to restore them so I dont need to resave them?];[Where are the playlists saved and how do we restore them if they get lost or are emptied somehow?];[I feel your pain bro. I saw my library playlists content go to zero after media scans and got the quot;...its not us, its Android...quot; answer from the PA team. So, lets get you out of this mess once and for all so you (and everyone suffering) can continue using PA and all its wonderful features. First, the simple difference between quot;libraryquot; and quot;file-basedquot; playlists. When you open PA and create a playlist with songs already on your device, they are saved as a quot;libraryquot; playlist. Ok, now turn to your computer. When you add songs to a PC program (Windows Media Player, iTunes, WinAmp, etc.) and choose File gt;gt; Save As gt;gt; PLAYLISTNAME.m3u, then you have just created a quot;file-basedquot; playlist. This .m3u file must be transferred to your device and when PA does a media scan, it will find it, but only if you have PA look in the folder on the device you transferred it to, such as anywhere inside quot;mntsdcardexternalsdMusicquot;. Trick is, you must use the filessongs already on your device to create the PLAYLISTNAME.m3u, ok? So, this is how I started using quot;file-basedquot; playlists. 1. Connect device to PC using USB mode (hopefully you know this basic step already) 2. On my device, Ive got a quot;Musicquot; folder located on my external SD card quot;mntsdcardexternalsdMusicquot;. Inside this folder, Ive got several sub-folders (quot;Electronicquot;, quot;Pop amp; Rockquot;, quot;R amp; Bquot;, quot;Rapquot;, quot;Reggaequot;, and finally quot;Z Miscquot;). 3. Inside each sub-folder, is another series of sub-folders which represent the contents of my quot;file-basedquot; playlists. For example, inside the quot;Electronicquot; folder is quot;E Ambientquot;. I use the E in quot;E PLAYLISTNAMEquot; to identify its Electronic music and keeps all my folders in alphabetical and genre order when Im in PA folder view. Its also a great way to preserve my playlists no matter what device I use. It keeps things organized by playlist and Im super-anal that way. Lose hours of playlist creation and youll know what I mean. So, in the quot;Electronicquot; folder I will see something like this : E Ambient E Breakbeat E Dance E Dubstep E Drum amp; Bass E Lounge E Mellow E Minimal E Trance 4. So, with my device USB connected to my PC, I use Windows Explorer to view the contents of the quot;E Ambientquot; folder which has 138 filessongs in it. I select all files gt;gt; right-click gt;gt; then choose quot;Add Files To Windows Media Playlistquot; or quot;Open Withquot; and choose your weapon. WMP opens up and in the quot;Now Playingquot; list contains the 138 files. If you dont see the files, look for the quot;Now Playingquot; tab at the top left of WMP and left-click it. 5. Now, go to File gt;gt; Save Playlist As gt;gt; PLAYLISTNAME.m3u and save it inside the quot;E Ambientquot; folder on your device which contains the 138 Ambient songs. 6. USB disconnect your device from the PC properly (look it up on numerous Android forums if you dont know how) 7. Your device should automatically begin its media scan. After it is finished, sometimes PA also begins its media scan, if its setup this way in your PA settings. Otherwise, open PA, then navigate to Settings (inside PA hit the quot;Menuquot; button on your device, which usually looks like two horizontal lines covered by a 3 sided-rectangle) gt;gt; select Rescan. 8. Exit quot;Settingsquot; and go to quot;Libraryquot; (at the bottom with Player and Folders) gt;gt; Playlists. You should see the heading quot;File-based Playlistsquot; and your newly created quot;E Ambient.m3uquot; playlist in that list. It will say quot;not loaded yetquot; below it every time PA does a media scan. Dont worry about that. Just select the quot;E Ambient.m3uquot; playlist and viola...#33;#33;#33; 9. Now, when you make an order change in that playlist and exit the playlist, it will save to the quot;E Ambient.m3uquot; file and your on-the-go changes save with it. Remember, addingremoving songs to the playlist in PA and exiting the playlist will not save the changes. You must change the order of at least one song and then exit the playlist. Best way to exit the playlist is to hit the header quot;Playlists E Ambient.m3uquot; at the top. On that header, to the right of the name, you will see 2 icons. 1 is an arrow pointing upwards, the other is the change order button which looks like an equal sign (i.e. quot;=quot;) with triangle points up and down on each line of the equal sign. Press that once to toggle it onoff. When its on, the icon will glow white. Go to a song in the list and press amp; hold the same icon now appearing to the left of each song and drag it up or down until you see a glowing horizontal line appear. Drop it in a different order position and then exit the playlist. You should see the words quot;E Ambient.m3u has been savedquot; appear at the bottom of the quot;File-based Playlistsquot; screen. It only fades in and out for 1-2 seconds so keep an eye out for it. This is very tedious the first time, but after creating the 38 PLAYLISTNAME.m3u files on my PC and saving them to the specific sub-folder in the external SD card quot;Musicquot; folder on my device, I never have to do that again and my playlists are protected from Android media scans. Tip : If later on I decided to add more songs via USB from my PC to the quot;E Ambientquot; folder on my device, I then go to quot;Foldersquot; in PA and press amp; hold the quot;E Ambientquot; folder gt;gt; select quot;Add to Playlistquot; gt;gt; select quot;E Ambient.m3uquot; and only the new songs will get added. I then go into that playlist in PA and change order and exit to save the .m3u file. Warning : Make sure you have Settings gt;gt; Advanced gt;gt; Lists gt;gt; tick quot;Dont add duplicatesquot; or the obvious will happen.];[Oh yeah, I also created some playlists called : E 1-On-The-Go.m3u P 1-On-The-Go.m3u R 1-On-The-Go.m3u (E = Electronic, P = Pop amp; Rock, R = Rap, etc.) ...with one or 2 songs in them so I can create and save on-the-go, spur of the moment playlists and never lose them.];
embedded cuesheet	Poweramp has supported independent .cue file, for those whole discrip lossless files. Would you consider appending the support to embedded cue (a tag named quot;Cuesheetquot; embedded in file)?

Frankly, with Foobar2000 there, I do not see market for a new audio player on Windows, unless Windows 8 comes to change everything and folks want PA on their tablets.

.pla orand auto-playlists	I was wondering why Poweramp does not recognize .pla playlists? Every other music program i used recognize them. And if this will not be supported, it would be great if you could make auto(smart)-playlists in Poweramp. Like: Id3 tag Genre = Hip Hop ID3 tag Year is between: 1990 and 2000 This playlist would then automatically put all the music in it which has those matching tags. or just: Year is between: 1970 and 1980 That would be a 70s music playlist. I use these things ALL the time in MusicBee, so it would be nice if i could just sync the .PLA playlists or create the auto-playlists myself in Poweramp.	playlist,pla,tag,id3,auto-playlist	21 November 2011 - 06:12 PM	mouseandkeyboard	[I am sure .pla support would arrive in a future update.];[That would be awesome#33; Have you got any idea if this is the near future.. or just sometime in the future?];

notification manual volume control	Hi, Can I first just say that Poweramp was already a great app, but the recent update made it nearly perfect for my needs. Its great to be able to move away from the ipod and keep gapless payback. The Crossfade is also a great feature that Ive been waiting for for quite some time. Onto the feature request: Would it be possible to create a setting that lets you set a volume that power amp fades to when you receive a notification? By which I mean that at the moment, when I receive a text message or email etc, then the volume completely fades out. Would it be possible to add a feature that lets you set it to fade to say 40 volume when the notification comes through?

widget colors	Im using the 4 X 1 widget from Poweramp 2.0.1 on a Droid Bionic running Android 2.3.4. I have album art not showing and the backgound transparent (looks compact that way).

walkman lock screen app	Personally I think Poweramp is an awesome player, with one huge flaw; the lock screen app is not good. I was considering for a long time to suggest for you to try and achieve the simplicity of Samsungs functional ditto, including a slide-to-unlock feature. However, this week I accidentally stumbled over an old nifty Live Wallpaper that mimic a Walkman cassette player. After a couple of seconds brainstorming I realized that this would be a perfect Lock Screen App#33; Maybe based on a design like this: http:i.telegraph.c...an1746181a.jpg With a visible, animated tape inside showing the current song written on it with some hand-written font of course. Roughly something like this: http:i44.tinypic.com28vwrnk.jpg The best would perhaps to render some transparent plastic above the tape and of course tape wheels rotating the tape. Most phones are usually black around the display today, so a deep black theme for the frame would probably work best to make the lock screen appear like a seamless part of the physical phone. Player controls and unlock slider design could be inspired by buttons like these: http:www.walkmance...oductswm-ex618 The actual tape animation could either be done by 3D graphics or simply by looping a short HQ shot of an actual tape playing. A 3D render would give the ability to actually use the tape to show how long the player has gone though the current playlist, by moving the tape from left to right. Please at least consider this idea, as I like the Walkman theme, but think it would be a lot more suitable as a lock screen app instead of those wallpaper or basic apps available today. Remember that Android 4.0 will have better notification bar access at the lock screen, so any other info on the lock screen might just clutter the layout. A small and visible popup on the lock screen showing the number of missed calls and messages would be useful though.	lock screen,walkman,theme,button	13 November 2011 - 12:41 AM	Duckofdeath	[Yes Yes and Yes Great idea Duckofdeath, that I previously brought up before on the Poweramp forums -skins topic I always dreamed of a skinthem like this for a music player.

In quot;Library ==gt; Artists ==gt; lt;an artistgt; ==gt; All Artist Songsquot;, I wish to have the list sortedseperated by albums first, and then by track number within those albums. I think this used to be the default behaviour? I just changed to a new phone and I cant work out how to set it like that anymore.

please change the new playlist system, it can not sync with system playlists	the new playlist system that can not sync with ANY system playlist is a real pain, it only recognizes the songs have been added through Poweramp itself. If the reason of this change is merging the folders amp; library playlists, then its not acceptable, because other player apps like PlayerPro amp; Meridian Player also support this feature and the playlist is recognizable for the system library. In Poweramp v2, when u make a new playlist it only works with Poweramp itself and u cant find it in for example native music app or any of syncing apps. this can really be an issue for users like me who carry thousands of tracks in several devices and syncing organized playlists is essential for them. Please consider this, I really love Poweramp and Ive always said that its the best player Iv ever used on any device or OS.

The lists I had created since the upgrade were still empty. Now I export the playlists, but looking at where they are exported to, I have multiple .m3u8. The original name, original name 1, original name 2. If I do another export I am sure I will get original name 3 and if I have to import them again how many lists am I going to get on my phone? I request that if I make a playlist in Poweramp, it just create 1 .m3u8 and overwrite the existing one cuz for 18 playlists I have 50 m3u8 files. Sure they are only 2-5kb in size but really? On top of that, at least one of the Imported playlists from the upgrade (which I renamed in Poweramp) is not listed in that #092;playlists directory. Please...

Often, when I go back to a list of Podcast, I dont remember which file I was listening the last time because each file has the same name except the record date. It would be great that Power Amp keep in memory the file I was listening in this library, even if I listen another music from another artist after.

be the first android player to support albums shuffle	Hi, What a great app#33; The thing that I really miss the most in my iPod nano is the ability to randomly choose an album and play its songs in-order. I think it should be fairly easy to implement because you already implement your own folderalbum library so you dont have to depend much on androids api. In order to achieve this functionality in the current state I change shuffle mode to shuffle-all, then click on next song, then change shuffle mode to shuffle-off, then go back a folder and next a folder and the result is I get a random album playing from the beginning in-order. This mode of operation includes many clicks on the shuffle button which brings up some more issues: Its hard to understand which shuffle mode is currently on, especially when driving, because the button is almost the the same for all modes and you have to read the toast in order to understand which shuffle is on. so a different icon for different shuffle types could also be useful. And also a checkboxes in the settings to select which shuffle modes to be included in the cycle when clicking on the shuffle button would make life easier for me, because I dont use the shuffle songs within folder type, so its an extra click each time I want to move from shuffle-all to shuffle-off. I hope that you take these feature requests and issues seriously... if this is hard to implement I can offer my programming services , but it seems that you DO know what you are doing... Thanks, J EDIT: I see that RC 2.0 has that feature#33;#33; yey#33;#33;	button,shuffle	01 November 2011 - 12:29 PM	zenpoy	[Thanks for the request, and yes, PowerAMP v2.0 has several new shuffle modes, including shuffle list (== shuffle album, if albums are played) and shuffle songs then shuffle list modes.];

headset buttons option, album art and auto-rescan?	Hi, Long time Poweramp user, first time poster#33; I love this app, i even delete the stock music player from my rom. I have a small problem with my phone where, if the headphones are connected to the jack and respond to headset buttons is selected, it will randomly change the track as if it thinks there is a button pushed, but my headphones have no buttons. I need to have respond to headset buttons selected for when i use my SE MW600 BT headset instead of the jack. My suggestion is to have respond to headset buttons AND respond to A2DP buttons options if this is possible. Another is to be able to choose to wipe album art for an individual album and re-download if the art is wrong and maybe to choose from a list of the graphics to ensure the correct one. Last one is to have an auto-rescan feature which the user can select when, eg. every start, daily, weekly, monthly.

artiststitles - neglect articles	Hi, this request, I believe, if accepted, will be added to the TODO list for 2.1 (or maybe a beta 3). I wonder if youd consider making Poweramp neglect the articles or other introductory words preceding an artist or an albums name. Im asking because the stock music player as well as other applications on different platforms (such as iTunes on Windows, or WMP itself) use this format. For instance: The Black Eyed Peas would appear along with the Bs instead of the Ts. Or The Eminem Show would appear in the Es list instead of the Ts list. Or A Little Bit Longer would be listed with the Ls. You get the idea. So, what do you think? Thanks, Huzefa	titles,albums,neglect,artist	17 October 2011 - 01:29 AM	HuzefaJonas	[Excellent idea.

Andre];[Agreed completely];[Yeah, this features been incorporated already (from Beta 2 amp; onward). Max, if youre reading this, thank you#33;];
youtube	I really love Poweramp and all its features. The only thing that sometimes annoying is when you go to watch a YouTube video and it doesnt automatically pause. If possible, could you integrate this feature into your next update? Also, is it possible to add a quot;backup settingsquot; feature to the app? Thank you for this great app and looking forward to any future updates#33;#33;	youtube,auto pause	21 October 2011 - 10:17 PM	storm1110	
gapped playback	The quot;gaplessquot; playback works well including the fades. Very cool. However, there are some albums that benefit from a gap between tracks of several seconds. It would be nice to have an option to select a gap between tracks in addition to gapless.	gapless,gap,playback,option	20 October 2011 - 03:02 AM	Marko	
can poweramp increase bass to car stereo?	I connect my HTC desire via usb to car stereo. I have an amp amp; subs. does this app increase bass to your car stereo? amp; if so, how do I do it?	connect,car stereo,usb	14 October 2011 - 09:38 AM	kingpikey	[Thanks for the request. Not sure how exactly your quot;usbquot; connection works for your audio. Do you connect your phone as storage?];
in my opinion...	Your app is so great enough#33; to satiafy me, but if you add direct QUIT button and built-in Shaker function. though there is shaker app for Poweramp on android market, it is too slow and inconvinient for me. Adding such features would make your app more perfect#33; Thanks for reading my requests#33;	quit,button	18 October 2011 - 12:27 PM	paperpiano	
resume on charge state andor car mode	Firstly, I absolutely love the app#33; I use it in the car every day. Along with the Resume on Headset Connect, how about ResumePause on Charge State and ResumePause on Car Mode. Each time I get in the car, I find myself restarting the song or skipping to the next one because it resumes where I left off. Having the option to jump to the start of the song if the player has been paused for more than 1530etc. minutes would be nice. On Resume by Headset Connect, etc. (anything other than manual unpause) If (time since last pause gt; 15 minutes) If (Track lt; 50) jump to beginning Else jump to next track Cheers.	skip,car mode,charge,resume	14 October 2011 - 11:14 AM	xmqgtrxpaj	[Wouldnt work for me (I tend to listen to long podcasts, so its great to just automatically resume from where I left off each time) but fine as an optional feature. Andre];[There is an app in the market called plug in launcher that would fix your resume on charge state problem.];[Thanks for the tip#33;];
a hot key	A hot key that the user can set (and change as desired) to go quickly to one specific place. i.e. to a specific playlist or to a specific folder or artist.	playlist,artist,folder,hot key	13 October 2011 - 07:52 PM	mc48	
gesture queuing	Hi, Can you (please) add a feature to add a song to the currently playing list (or the queue) by swiping on it (swipe left to play next, swipe right to play last) while browsing the library? Thanks#33;	playlist,queue,library,gesture	11 October 2011 - 09:27 PM	HuzefaJonas	
playlist specific shuffle	when im in folders i like to listen to albums in order. when im in my folder playlist id like to have it set to shuffle. it might be cool to add an option when hitting shuffle to play shuffle all files, this folder, this folder always, shuffle off.	04 apr 2011,--	04 April 2011 - 05:05 PM	Thisguy&lt;--	[PowerAMP has few shuffle modes, including shuffle the folder. Pressing SHUFFLE button in main screen will switch modes: Shuffle All = Shuffle current (folderplaylistalbumartistetc) = Shuffle None. Long press on SHUFFLE button shows the menu with available modes. Shuffle current * mode depends on which list PowerAMP is actually playing at the moment. Thanks!];[ya i know, and thats awesome, but there is no shuffle that is attached to play list or listening mode, so that if you browse to your folder playlist shuffle current folder automatically engages, and if you are listening to regular folders it automatically shuts shuffle off. so i was thinking you could add the option of shuffle mode to "shuffle current folder always" and power amp remembers your preference for activating shuffle when you listen to that playlist.];
