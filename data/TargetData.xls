option: pressing back button to return to player from any libararyplaylist to r	I would like the option in Settings to be able to enable the use of pressing the Back button to return back to the Player while using the Library or playlsists screens		18 February 2013 - 01:49 AM	haddy	[Poweramp is virtually perfect apart from this problem with the back button. Please make it an option in settings menu to enable the back button to go back from the player screen to the previous screen as opposed to exiting Poweramp.];[thanks for agreeing. There should be an option for it in the Settings];[+1 for this... Well the opposite of the OP and exactly what astro said... Been using power amp for about a year now. F-n love it. The back button is THE only annoying thing about it. And it is just out of habit... When on the now playing screen and I want to go BACK to the list to pick a new song the obvious and first instinct you have is to press the BACK button. Nope... it just exits the whole app lol. Seems like something very basic and fundamental. "Back to go back" not "back to close". Idk... Just Please add this... Its very annoying in the car while driving to have to navigate backwards using on screen buttons and accidentally closing the entire app from hitting the back button out of instinct and navigating through the app all over again , when I could just hit the physical back button without even taking my eyes off the road. See now its a safety issue, Poweramp devs. I dont want my blood on your hands lol. No seriously. The back button should have the same function as any other app or the systemui: back button takes you backwards to the previous screen... So if I navigate from librarygt;artistsgt;artistgt;albumgt;song(now playing) and I hit back 4 times, I should be back at the library screen. Just seems like common sense... I dont mean that in an offensive way at all. Your app is amazing.];[What Wturner859 said... oh please god, implement this...lol I agree its the one problem with the app, and extremely annoying. Other than this, I love the app.];[+1! This is the only thing that I dont like about Poweramp. Everything else is 5 stars. There has been a lot of discussion about this issue. While I understand that its normal in android for the back button to (sometimes) take you out of an app and to the home screen, given that it has a different function in Poweramp in everything but the Player, you just get used to it and expect it to do the same thing. I still cant get used to this after almost 6 months. Please make it an option!];[Settings gt; look and feel gt; startup screen gt; change this to last played list I think this will give you the functionality you are looking for.];
u.i. overall change and change the font to the default font introduced in ics	With lots of apps updating their themes and font to fit in with the theme introduced in Ice Cream Sandwich. I just thought that Poweramp, being such a successful app would put this into consideration.		Yesterday, 08:53 PM	GiantKillerHedgehog	
add function of play after it	like windows media player add this function like browsing through song list and i found one good song but dnt want to reset the current playlist so what i will do ... please provide this option like long click on song to show menu then hold the play button to add it next to the current playing one :-) thanks and regards Poweramp for such a good player		Yesterday, 08:28 AM	gamerlucky	[Does the long-press gt; Enqueue option not basically do that? You can adjust how tracks get queued via Poweramp Settings gt; Folders and Library gt;Queue (e.g. whether to play the new track immediately, or after the current song or playlist, etc) Andre];[thanks bro let me try it];
prefer embedded album art on a per track basis	Hi all, Ive got several albums worth of commercially purchased MP3s, where an image is embedded in each track in a kind of high-tech liner notes artwork deal. At the moment, only a single track is scanned, and this is used as a cached image for the whole album, so you never see the other images. Is it possible to add an option to disable album art caching, to force a check of "album" art for each track?		12 June 2013 - 07:54 PM	breadlord	[Does unticking any of the Prefer options in Settings gt; Album Art help? Andre];[Aha! Yes. Clearing all of the checkboxes and clearing the album art cache seems to have sorted it. Thanks for the help.];
car profile	Hi, Im using Poweramp on a nexus7 in my car. It works, but it would be easier to operate if we could choose a variation of the interface with bigger controls and fonts. Also a big volume control on screen all the time would be very handy. Big horizontal sliding volume control. In a car and driving is important to have big controls. I always press the wrong button! thanks		Yesterday, 12:13 AM	ricren	
license without google play, google account and other email account	I want to use full version on a device without Google Play, Google account and other email account services (for batteryperformance reasons). Is it possible? I allready bought the unlocker from Google Play. I would buy the full version apk license if needed (you well deserve to pay twice) Thank you		12 June 2013 - 12:15 PM	catalin74	[imho the unlocker is the full version.There¡äs only the free trial version which can be unlocked and made to a full version with it.And you can buy it here,no need to have a google acc. for that];
music frequency progress bar and others	I tried them all (literally), Poweramp is the best and most powerful music player on android. But, of course, it could be better. 1. Search results shorting. Usually it shorts closest match for albumsgt;artistsgt;songs. But I like to see closest songsgt;artistsgt;albums. I know this is too personal, but it really annoys me. At least a simple "search shorting options" under settings would be great. 2. A-B loop playback. This is a main absence on a pro music player like Poweramp. 3. Music frequency progress bar (like soundcloud). I saw it on a concept music player app and just loved it. You can actually see the song and skip the lower or higher frequencies with one click. Great idea for both design and function. 4. Lyrics. Its not functional on current version. When you open a song lyrics from tag, you say goodbye to the player. Can you add a transparent and scrollable layer on album art area for lyrics? And an option under settings or "options" menu to "show lyrics" (if available)? Thank you for reading.		15 May 2013 - 10:22 PM	heimatlos	[4. Lyrics. Its not functional on current version. When you open a song lyrics from tag, you say goodbye to the player.

group by album artist compilation support	Sorry if Im the hundredth person to request this, but after moving to Android from iOS (which admittedly took far too long to implement it on their end too), one thing I definitely miss is being able to primarily display album artists for compilations. As such my artists list is cluttered with artists that only have one song in my library. Being able to hide these would making browsing much faster.		09 July 2012 - 08:27 PM	motelkillafornia	[Yes please#33;];[Ditto.];[You are hundredth person, all in separate posts ( I dont know why), but yes we are going to work on this for 3.0];[Actually, I think one or two people have bumped several older threads. But still a useful feature though. Andre];[All I want to see is a checkbox in the settings that reads "prefer album artist for sorting". That way the Artist view in the Library wont be cluttered, but actually viewing an individual track will show the artist tag with the "feat. WhoEver", etc. If there is no album artist tag, then use the artist tag as is the case presently.];[I have already made a request for this functionality.http:forum.poweram...dpagep9422 DamnMersaultWhen U are in a library view and rollup menu U will see a position "Options". There you can turn on and off whatever position of sorting you wish, so there in so need to implement checkbox which you are talking about.];[Lets get album artist tag support quick!];[Posting the same message six times might get you noticed as a spammer...Andre];[Thanks, Andre! Not trying to be a spammer. Im just a big fan of Poweramp and am trying to point out the number of threads all asking for the same functionality. Weve been waiting on this a long, long time. Thank you for the heads-up.];[The way XBMC works is the "Artists" list is populated using the "Album Artist" tags from the MP3. They also have an option to hide artists that only appear on compilation. Id really like to see this implemented (at least as an option, for "Artists from Album Artists"). Hopefuly 3.0 isnt too far, cause this is a big annoyance for me. Having to maintain a properly tagged (with MusicBrainz Picard) library and a duplicate library with "simplified" artist tags so that i can copy it to my phone (using a 64gb sdcard for music, full).];
please add support for various itunes tags	Could support for the following tags be added: Album Artist: For albums that should be listed under a different name than the artist on some or all of the tracks. For instance, a Syd Barrett compilation may have tracks by Pink Floyd and by Syd Barrett; the songs "Artist" tags should have the correct respective artist, but the entire album should be shown as by Syd Barrett.Compilation: For "Various Artists" releases. This would enable compilations to appear at the end of the album listing, showing "Various Artists" as the artist. It would also fix the related problem where if you now have two albums with the same name, they appear as one album in the album listing. This behavior would no longer be necessary if it only combined tracks that had the "Compilation" tag set. Artist Sort and Album Artist Sort: So that artists can be sorted by last name. Album Sort: Not as necessary as the others, but would still be useful in some instances. Thanks#33;		28 November 2011 - 08:18 PM	skeezix	[Support for Extended Tags is coming soon See: http:forum.poweram...es-in-progresshttp:forum.poweram...-copyright-etc];[Im not an iTunes user, but would like to see support for additional "sort" tags - ARTISTSORT, ALBUMARTISTSORT for example, as well as support for ALBUMARTIST. I have some albums where I want identified by ALBUMARTIST to keep things together. For example, I have Crossroads which includes songs which have as Artist: Eric Clapton, Cream, Derek and the Dominoes. Id like it to have it default to the Album Artist (Eric Clapton). Also, Id like the option to sort on ARTISTSORT so that I find Eric Clapton under "C" instead of "E" (my ARTISTSORT is "Clapton, Eric"). Thanks#33;];[This.];[Were improving the tag support for the newer version of Poweramp, so tags will be improved.];[At this moment, we added support for Album Artist for Id3v2, ape, oggflacopus and m4a encoded tags. Appropriate changes to library are now applied. Thanks#33;];[I would highly appreciate support for the Sort Album tag. I have tagged all my mp3s with the release date in the Sort Album field (format: YYYY.MM.DD). On my iPhone and also in iTunes this automatically sorts all the albums from one artist in chronological order instead of alphabetical. Also when displaying a list of all the albums on the device they are presented in chronological order.];[I would also to see this, ie a Album Release Date "subsort". The scenario presented above is a great example... Especially with Artists who have many albums, the ability to also sort by date would be a great additon .];[When will this be pushed to the app version in the Android store? I havent seen any app updates since this post.];[I do exactly the same thing - it just makes so much more sense to me to organise albums and singles by release date, rather than alphabetically#33; I would buy this app in an instant if you could include the Sort Artist and Sort Album fields];[Am I missing something? I have a .mp3 collection all using id3v2, and all use album artist; however, I dont see how to organize by album artist in Poweramp.];[The album artist tag would be a welcome addition to the app.];
support for #34;album artist#34; filed.	In the library there are views: - Artists, - Albums by Artist. Both of them are unusable and useless for me. I really, really miss for support for "album artist view". What is difference between "artist" and "album artist": http:forums.iloung...bum-artist.html I will be grateful for adding support of this field.		01 February 2012 - 07:53 PM	kamil_w	[I would really not like to be forced to use album artist. Certainly fine as an option, but I like to know and navigate every artist on every compilation.];[Who talks about forcing? Im not saying to set this view as the only one. I just would like to have it as option. It can be even hide as default like sorting "Albums by artist".];[I cant imagine this being that complicated to implement, and I usually have to default to folder tree organization in order to get to what I am looking for quickly. Speaking of which, folder tree organization doesnt work properly in Poweramp, Ill post in bug section.];[x1000. It should be pretty simple to add this category to the top level of the library. I would REALLY like to see all of my Various Artists albums in one place instead of a bunch of artists with one track each.];[Id appreciate this too. Especially if youre using Poweramp to play your iTunes library its kinda confusing at the beginning. In iTunes all artists are properly grouped while in Poweramp one album gets split in several parts because of featurings or other things. An album artist option (maybe just in "list" properties) woul be perfect#33;];[Same here. I looked at switching to Player Pro just for this feature...but as you note, it doesnt work. Google Music supports it, but is far too bare bones in other areas. So Im sticking with Poweramp, hoping well see it soon.];[Yes, please. Shouldnt be very difficult.];[+1 for this, would really like to see all my 1-hit-wonders from the compilation albums gone from my Artists list.];[+1];[Want it badly. Right now it is quite difficult to navigate through the library. What I really crave is having an option of providing a custom sequence of custom tags to be used to granulate the library, potentially with a different sorting (e.g. navigate using album artist#092;album#092;track sorted by album artist#092;date#092;discnumber-tracknumber)];[What a great idea, a custom sort option where you can create your own multi-level order from a list of parameters. Using a minus sign before the to mean reverse-order for that parameter Id assume. Really, really, good idea#33; Andre];[Yes please#33; Album artist support would be great#33;];[This would be a very good, practical option to have. I didnt see the need until I added a few compilation albums (various artist) to my library#33;];[Adding to the clamor... I would definitely like to see Album Artist tag supported in Poweramp. Ill be a paying customer if you do.];[Im hoping that Poweramp would be able to be the market leader in terms of media organisation too, in addition to it being a good playback app. I also know other friends who would be more than willing to purchase a copy if proper album artist tag support is implemented.];[Were working on improving these features with 3.0 so no worries#33;];[+1 for this Admin, when can we expect 3.0 to be out?];[Bump. Not having an album artist view is really a show stopper. When I list by artist I have 100s (yes literally 100s) of one shot artists from various electronic compilations. With all this noise in my artist list I cant navigate easily through my collection to find what I want. For these compilations, there is always an overall DJArtist that put the compilation together that I want to list by. Hence "album artist". This should be a very quick and easy addition.];[+1];[+1];[Yes, yes, yes#33; This is definitely a feature I would appreciate. Would be very beneficial for me if as well as listing items by Artists you could choose to view a list in order of Album artists. I have loads of classical compilations with various Artists and would like to have the option to be able to see all these albums listed together. Very big fan of how you can view list by Artists but then order the albums so all albums by the same artists show in a row - would be one great step further to be able to do this with Album Artists. LETS DO IT#33;];[Yes, please#33;#33;#33; As soon as possible... ;-) After that, Poweramp is going to be the REAL number one#33; :-)];[+1 Essential feature.];[+1 Im amazed the "album artist" field support is not implemented yet. Now I realize why my artist list is that long#33; Also Im glad the moderator subscribes the importance of the correct ID3v2 implementation. But, cant this be fixed in a maintanance update v2.0.9? I love to test the v3 beta, but doubt if such large overhaul will be bug free during the lifespan of my phone#33; So please, make sure the v2.x will be kept availlable as the "classic version".];[ID3v2 has had several useful tags (album arist, year, composer, ...) for some times now. I find them very powerful to organize my musical collection, except on Android I could not find the "perfect" player, every one is missing something. So far the best for me is Poweramp, if it did support a few more tags it would be so close to perfect...];[Sooooooooo, how are we getting on with this?];[+1 really needs to be implemented. What I also would like to see is support for multiple artists, I use this pattern: artist1; artist2 in my tags (FLAC) and Poweramp only shows artist1 as artist.];[Essential feature. Something like this shouldnt be overlooked. I literally cant browse my library until its implemented.];[Essential feature. I have a lot of album compilations and without this my player list is all messy.];[Please add support for the album artist tag.];

multiple artistgenre tag support#33;	There are always songs which have multiple artists, and similarly one song can have elements of multiple genre. MediaMonkey on my PC does a nice job of supporting these multiple tags by separating the tags by a semicolon, and syncs them to my GS2 as such as well. Androids default player, as well the my GS2 player, and all other major players dont have support for these multiple tags. So what happens is that I end up getting, as an example, three different artists - "Shaggy", "Akon" and "Shaggy;Akon". Since there is no single artist by name "Shaggy;Akon", it doesnt get a picture and music library just falls apart. Can you please parse these multiple tags properly and add one song under multiple artistsgenres in the library depending on if the tag has multiple artistsgenres. Thank you#33;		13 October 2011 - 07:03 PM	kitkat	[ID3v2 standards actually allow you to have multiple separate instances of the same tag, which would also be nice to support where reasonable (such as artist, genre, composer, etc, obviously not title or album)];[Multiple artist support would be great for me too. Maybe you could even auto-split the artist tag where you see the term "feat." in the working (where did that come from over recent years anyway? In the good old wax-cylinder days it was simply called a duet#33; ) Andre];[Coming to think about it, it would be pretty neat, and useful. I request Poweramp author to please come and comment here if he would support this feature and when.];[+1 The way its currently done is broken. e.g. I see a genre "Theme:Soundtrack" for some songs that are tagged as "Theme" and "Soundtrack". The same songs appear neither in "Themes" nor "Soundtrack" but only the non-existent genre "Theme:Soundtrack".];[Being able to set a tag separation character similar to squeezecenter would be wonderful. My library has a number of "sub-genres" (eg. "Classical;Chamber") that would be best indexed as multiple genres. Most music players cant handle that or multiple artists well.];[Multiple genre support would be great, please add this option. Regards from Spain];[It would be great. I am from India and our song are mainly from Indian movies, mostly duet sons than singles. song filter option is the only way to play all songs of a particular artist irrespective of solo or duet or group song . I am eagerly waiting for the update, thank you for the post.];[Just as a followup... it appears to already support "multiple genre" tags (separated with ";"), just not multiple artists.];[No it doesnt support multiple file tags, even with ";" Poweramp only take the first genre. Sorry if i dont understand you, my english is so bad.];[I currently have albums on my phone with MP3 "genre" tag set as "Classical;Horn", "Classical;Viola" and "Classical;WWQuintet". When looking in the PowerMP Library, these show under both the genre "Classical" and the genres "Viola", "Horn" or "WWQuintet". The embedded tag (eg. "Classical;Horn") is *not* shown as a genre. This part works well for me. The part that doesnt work is that Id like to browse from genre -gt; artist -gt; album (eg. "Classical" -gt; "Mozart, Wolfgang Amadeus" -gt; "Requiem, K626 - Hogwood"), but once you choose genre, you can only only choose albums.];[I registered simply to say +1#33;PLEASE IMPLEMENT THIS FEATURE PROPERLY#33;It would change the way users can browser music on their phones and tablets#33;];[+1 as well. Signed up and searched precisely just for this exact thread. Ive no idea why its taken this long still for any of the PMP software to implement such an integral part of song tagging. Please, Please, PLEASE consider adding this soon. People who care about categorizing their music properly are being left out in the cold because such a simple feature is yet to be supported.];[Exactly. I cannot use my large music collection on my Android devices since Ive organized it using multiple tags. I think the Linux player gmusicbrowser has a perfect implementation of this feature, in case hints are required to the execution. It really would be wonderful#33;];[just like I separate genres with ";" I would really like the same to work with artists. +1];[A feature like this would be great. I have many songs with multiple artists and Poweramp lists them as a new artist instead of separating them.];[+1];[Can a developer please reply? I really want this feature.];[+1 to this. To be honest, I never knew of such feature, but after reading posts from you guys, it really is something that is very interesting as well as better for organization.];[any news on this future support?];
ratings and mediamonkey tags	People are putting more and more music on their smartphones and some people even use their Android Phones and tablets as PC replacements and their primary music player .... What is missing is the ability to view the ratings of tracks before you choose them to play. Displaying the rating as the track is being played isnt really useful at all. So my request is: 1) Display the rating of tracks in the library view. For example ....... I open Poweramp, choose the Album Tab and then see a listing of albums, I tap an album "Best of Elton John" and see a listing of all the tracks on that album plus the rating for every track at the same time. I then easily pick the best tracks. 2) Properly read Media Monkey tags, preferably all of them ..... It can be done .....		05 June 2013 - 10:53 PM	Sirandar888

google music support	Hi, I have all my music library uploaded to Google Music, and I would like to play offline music direclty into Poweramp. I just got an external app "Offline Music Importer", but it simply move music from Google Cache to another location adding back name and i3d tag.

edit playlist in poweramp?	Hello, members of this Forum! I have a short question: How can I edit (spc. delete) the entries in my play list of Poweramp? I want to tell you exactly what I mean: I use the full version of Poweramp on a Galaxy S3! I have created a new (first) playlist called "standard". In the meantime the playlist contains 35 titles. Is it possible to delete some of these titles and HOW can I do this? I cannot find an option for that. If I choose the option "playlist" from the main option menu, I get an overview over my playlists (here f.e. "standard"), but I cannot edit it. It is also impossible to delete the whole playlist. Can someone give me an advice? Many greetings from Germany UweBast		03 June 2013 - 02:22 PM	UweBast	[Long-press on the individual track in the Library playlist view (or on the playlist title itself) and select Delete from the menu.

option to eliminate gaps around the album art	Hi I like Poweramp a lot, but Im wondering if I can make the album art fill up the screen, so that the gap around the album art gets eliminated.If the gap is gone, it would look like this screenshot from PlayerPro.I think the gaps are just wasting the space, so if you fix it or add an option to stretch the album art to fill up the gaps, I would appreciate it.

regarding album art	Was wondering if it were possible to create an option to fill the entire box with the album art instead of zooming in?

#34;unknown album#34; option in poweramp ui and its widget	Instead of showing Unknown Album, would it be possible to have an option to hide Album information in the player and its widget? It might sound odd but some people dont keep album information in files tag.		23 November 2011 - 10:07 AM	proliant	[I agree. I have about 1000 tracks, over 900 have "Unknown Album".];[Well I like Unknown Album - so it must be kept and any feature to remove it, must be optional.];[Please developers think about this, i made forum profile because i hate "unknown album"];[Agreed, Id prefer to have it not displayed too (optionally if needs be). Ive got tons of single tracks which have no album info assigned to them (or if they did, I deleted it so they didnt get grouped in odd ways here and there).

ability to remove player from notification area	Been a long time fan and faithful user of PA! First post here to your forums because Im finding frustration with a feature (setting). Im trying to remove the player from the notification bararea. Heres why.... I have a setting on my ROM (Xylon) that allows the notification bar to be hidden unless a notification comes in. This is perfect for my minimalist and highly custom home screen design. However, when using PA (which is all the time), the notification bar is visible because the PA icon is there. If I swipe down my notification, the player is there and I can control it as needed. I would like to see that feature be an option in the notification bararea. I see in settingslook and feelstatus barnotification "Notification Priority" where I can define the notification position. However, if I set this to minimum (the lowest setting), it removes the icon from the notification bar but the player still remains in the notification area which keeps my notification bar visible. So the option would need to be such that you can choose if you want the player in the notification area or not. Love the player.....its the only one Ill ever use Cheers!

rich notification customization (jelly bean)	Hello, Id like to ask for some customization options for the new Jelly Bean style rich notification (see a screenshot under the spoiler). The first option is to disable the tracks counter ("360369") because it takes quite a lot of space needed for long trackartist+album names, and I dont actually need this counter. Also, when it is displayed, it could be placed in line with track name or artist+album instead of covering both lines. The second option is to choose an album art transition animation, or at least to disable the current "zoom in - zoom out" animation. Thank you. Spoiler		25 May 2013 - 08:45 AM	PeterMinin

multiple file operations	Hi, I must say Im very happy with Poweramp. For my needs its almost perfect. One thing that has been sorely missing though is the ability to perform some operations for more filesfolders at once. Most notably these should include enqueing, adding to playlist, deletion and playlistqueue manipulation. Is there a chance this could be implemented? I imagine a multi-operation switch similar to the queue-manipulation switch in queue view could be added to all views which upon activation would show checkboxes to the left of filenames and any operation performed would apply to the whole selection of files. It wouldnt really clutter up the interface and would be hugely beneficial. Thanks for considering this! Petr		22 May 2013 - 09:44 AM	ego42	
custom smart playlists	Sorry if this has already been brought up before (I did search). I looked at the upcoming features too but didnt see anything specific to this. One of the smart playlists that I would like is to have is all tracks with 0 plays. This may not necessarily be recently added tracks that already have plays (externally or otherwise). Instead of creating a smart playlist to suit everybodys needs, could you create custom smart playlist functionality instead? For example, I could create a new smart playlist and specify that play count = 0.		06 September 2012 - 03:58 PM	mlsmith	[Good idea, well see if this can be done. Thanks for that though. I dont think recently added songs can be an exception if this is added, but still a good idea.];[Thanks for the quick response, Wen#33; Another thing if I may, could you also add the ability to view play counts for each track as well as method for marking them as played? The reason I ask is because I would use this functionality with the custom playlist that I previously mentioned. Any new music that I add to my phone would show up in that playlist. BUT, if I add older music to my phone that I dont necessarily want to listen to at the moment, I can mark them as played and they would drop out of the playlist. If adding this functionality is not possible right away, it would be nice if we could store an SQLite database on the SD card and then change the play count manually using a DB editor. Just a thought...];[It would be great if we had in Poweramp smart playlists similars to the ones there are in Winamp (windows version). So we would be able to create, for instance, lists of all rock n roll songs from 1970 to 1979 with 3 or more stars. All automatically updated.];[Just a note, you can also just shuffle the "most played" songs in the "Most Played" playlist over in the library section.

multiple artists	Hello, at the Moment I always used free Apps for playing Music, but I am looking for a better app for it. But I am looking for one special feature before i buy an app. What I am looking for is a feature for multiple Interprets, so that I can find a Song by different Artist. For Example I have sort my Songs like "Artist 1; Artist 2" and I wish the Song would Display by the Songs of Artist 1 and by the Songs Of Artist 2 and not by "Artist 1; Artist 2".

please add more support for whole album listeners	Hi there, Poweramp is a quite good player, but for me it lacks some important features as I am only listening to complete album (I know, very old school behaviour). For example the "recently added" list is only song based, which is absolutly irrelevant to me. I#180;d like to see which albums I recently added and add it as a whole and not file by file to my playlist. As well there should be a album oriented playlist or at least album related operations on playlists like removing complete albums and so on. Hopefully somethings like this can be seen in some of the next releases.

It would be also good just to play an album from folder view and have it stop at the end of that album without bothering to put each invidual album into a separate folder.

It has also other features such as m3u export which you can play with Poweramp.];
ratings from tags	I am new to using Poweramp and was just shocked to realize it doesnt use the tags for ratings. The whole reason I dumped Apple and itunes was because they didnt adhere to standards.

If we had at least a comment from developers that this feature would be implemented it would be sufficient for me.

Unfortunately I found Music Player Pro to be inferior by far to Poweramp and Ive already paid for Poweramp and really love it in almost every other aspect. Are there any plans to implement this soon?

gui and widget suggestions	Greetings, I have a few ideas for possible improvements to Poweramp that might make for a more enjoyable experience for users like myself. 1. Swipe widget support - I rely on the swipe gesture to change tracks in the car so being able to use that with the widget would be great. Im not much of a widget user but my recent deck upgrade makes it more viable. I love how customizable the widget pack is but the gesture support would really bring it to another level. 2. Rearrange the landscape button placement - Having the back and forward buttons stacked on the right side makes it very difficult to utilize their functions, especially while driving. Its such a small area and I almost always miss my intended target. If there was an option to rearrange how the meta data and art are arranged, the landscape interface would be more user friendly. Id love the option of moving the art over to the left and putting the meta data to its right, much like the older version of Google Play Music (Im not sure how the new version works; it crashes on my phone before I ever get a chance to try it). 3. More customization options for the interface - The widget is highly tweakable and Id like to see more of those options show up in the full app. Even just being able to adjust the opacity of the track infoprogress bar and the text style of that info would be a huge improvement. I havent looked into skinning and whats possible with that so maybe these issues arent even rooted in Poweramp but rather the themes. If custom skins can alter the layout, Ill look further into that option. Im sure some of these have been requested before but I dont recall seeing them when I looked through recent posts. At any rate, Id love to see some of these implemented in future releases. Also, voice commands would be excellent but that has been requested quite a bit. ;-) All the best, TheJacksonCinco		17 May 2013 - 03:08 PM	TheJacksonCinco

additional volume steps	Ello.As you know, Android has 16 media volume steps and Im sure plenty of people experienced the occasion where one step up and the music gets too loud, while one step down and it gets too quiet. The explanation given here is a fair point, as well as the EQ solution, but were pretty late here into the modern age and Poweramp seems mature enough to handle such a thing.Currently Im using an app called Fine Volume Control which is clumsy and overall feels like money down the drain just to cover up for the OSs lack of features. Anyhow, thats the suggestion. I think 48 steps and above should do the trick.Also, great app. Well worth the fee.		18 April 2013 - 07:14 PM	DeeKay	[More volume please];
spectrum analyzer	I love the player, but would like a simple 10 or 12 band spectrum analyzer to watch while I listen. Whatcha think?		16 February 2013 - 07:48 AM	meshback	[Already been requested. Yes I support this too +1];[Me too#33; +1 What about something similar at the spectrum analyzer of the old version of MIUI player?];[+10 Ive been asking this for ages...still nothing...];[I have been wishing for this as well. I use this in my car with the pioneer appradio and arliberator app. I have used audio glow app and had great success but I really wish the media player itself (Poweramp) had a visualizer built in.];[I support this too];
simple thing that will make the difference.	First off, I am in love with your app. You guys rock, no doubt about it. Here are a few things that will make it even more better ( from my point of view and the way i am using it): - Add to queue button beside each songfolder (single tap type of thing). It will be more simple than hold the songfolder and then tap on add to queue. - Resume song after a phone call has be accepted or made. I do have a remote on my earphones but for people who dont have it, it will be great that it resume the song that was playing before the phone call. Thats all for now. Thanks a lot. EDIT: Thanks Mikeyd85		13 May 2013 - 06:18 PM	frenchinho	[Resume after call is a setting that can be found in Settings gt; Audio gt; Audio Focus];
flac lyrics support	In times of higher storage capacities, all of my music is converted into Flac. Unfortunately, Poweramp does not support lyrics in Flac files. Will this feature ever be added?

always showing player	Is there a way for power amp to always display on the HTC One smartphone like the Amazon mp3 player? When you turn on the phone, you come to the screen lock which displays the time and weather. If I am playing music using the Amazon mp3 player, a small bar will appear showing the player playing along with what is playing. So I dont have to unlock the screen to really do anything (change songs whatever). Is there a way the power amp can do this or no?		13 May 2013 - 10:19 PM	magicka	[You may do it in Poweramp menu: Settings=gt;Lock Screen=gt;Enable ICS Lock Screen (check it), but it will stay on lock screen only if Poweramp is running and you did not exit it.];

ios version	I know that there are other threads requesting an iOS version of Poweramp... I just want to add myself to the list for this request as the comparison to the stock iOS player (and every freepaid app version in itunes) is like comparing dry, no-named dog food to Poweramps kobe beef tenderloin.

option to scan the root level of a device	I am having a problem with a device which has changed the path location of the attached storage containing my music.

less crossfade time, and no fade in	Ill give you an example of what a have with winamp on mi windows pc: - Gappless tracks - Fadeout time on previous track 500ms - Fade in time on next track 0ms (disable) - Crossfade time: 500ms I could had root the phone to get it cracked for free, But it so fits what i could never do with an iphone, and what i always wanted in a music app, that i had to buy it. Thank you.		30 April 2013 - 08:40 PM	fernsx	[I also remember a wonderful option on an older phone that I used to use way back.You could define a specific dB level for mixes, so that the next track would start playing once the current tracks volume level got down to a particular value at the end. This made for nice smooth transitions on tracks which fade out, but it didnt incorrectly crossfade through a sudden-stop track (one that ends on a final drumbeat for example). Same logic could be applied for the start of the next track: if it comes in at full-level, dont fade in. However if it starts gradually, then use the same sort of logic to determine the overlap point.Andre];
critical feature - quot;listen toquot; google voice support!	I am not talking about a button that is built into the app itself, but using the voice search on your phone (that is used for nav, internet searches, voice dial, etc) by saying "Listen to..." and then speaking the Album, Title, etc. There is some piece of code needed in the player app for Googles voice search to recognize. I am sure somewhere on the android dev forums is how to add this feature. As of now there are only 5 different players (Pand, Slkr, mSpot, Rdio, and one other) that work with Googles voice search; in fact even the default music player written by google will not come up as an option (as of yet). On their home page Google lists the five software players the do work with this feature. Not only will adding this feature be amazing, but it will get your software on a very short list of android music players Google has listed on their site! IMO if you can bang out an update for your player quickly, you will benefit from the free advertising on Googles webpage, which I am sure you realize would be quite beneficial when your app goes paid.		06 November 2010 - 07:06 PM	Thalinor	[+1 for the idea but I cant say it is a critical feature. Its more of a convenience feature and a nice to have.

dlna support	I think Poweramp is the best music player solution. I use it a lot with headphones but I often use DLNA option from standard android player to stream music to my TV or Xbox360. DLNA is supported by almost every device at our homes, pc, tv, console etc.. Wouldnt it be nice to have such feature in Poweramp? It takes ages with standard player because it is so dumb, it adds also ringtones or navi sounds to library where Poweramp is better because of folder filtering. Also it makes no sense to switch from Poweramp to stream something with standard player. Is it possible to add such feature? Somebody with me on this request?

ability to set notification priority and more	Hi, It would be very useful if you added the feature that could set the priority of Poweramps notification widget. I use Power Toggles app that allows you to perform a lot of stuff via single notification widget locked on top. However, when I play music via Poweramp, its notification extrudes the Power Toggles one and goes on top. Not only it is on top, but it is also expanded thus taking a lot of space. Please, take this into account because both apps are great and cannot be substituted. Also tried similar app - Notification Toggles, but thing was the same... As an additional feature you could include the ability to choose between expandable and non-expandable widgets.		28 April 2013 - 12:36 PM	dan_bold

quick back 5 seconds	I heard some audios that need to back and listen again some times.

If not customisable, Id suggest backwards be a 10 second jump and forwards a 30 second jump. Id also like to be able to separate the fast-forwardfast-rewind buttons away from the next-trackprevious-track buttons. You cant currently fast-rewind for a very short amount of time, as pressing the button for too short a time goes to the previous track instead. These extra buttons should be skinnable of course, as not everyone may want them cluttering up their display.

But if that makes the product harder to use, I would say keep the buttons and make the album art smaller. Maybe make it a skin option? Then you could also offer a skin version with just a massive PlayPause button in the middle and nothing else, for the people who complain about too much functionality. Andre];[How about settings to control how the lt;lt; and gt;gt; worksreacts.. would that be a good solution?];[i think this is a very smart solution. personally, id change the rewind and foward buttons to skip some seconds, and change previous and next song to do other things.. i actually change music using the touch. a customizable toolbar is awesome idea.];[What about you hold the button to get quick access to how long it should skip, like the shuffle and repeat?];[That would be great, customizable button, and not adding new ones. I would prefer to change the gt;gt; or lt;lt; buttons to quick back or forward 5, 10 or even 60 seconds. Please make it happen];[Yes, I too wonder if there is any news such very simple functionality requests? Im sure its lovely to be able to make fancy customisations to the look of widgets to everyones hearts content, but personally I never use them and Id prefer greater focus to be allocated to much-needed playback control functionality for longer audio files within the core player itself. Adding extra "-10sec" and "+30sec" buttons (for example) would be the perfect solution, and keeping them optionaleditable would make everyone happy. (and I like the above idea from Enitoni of using long-press to adjust the skip time settings) Andre];[I support this idea with all my heart. Currently, Poweramp is not really suitable for audiobookpodcast listening, especially if you do it in a foreign language and have to go backward from time to time.

dsee on sony walkmans	I recently purchased a Sony NWZ-F806 and was not too impressed with the stock player that it came with. I felt it was a step back in some aspects to my VERY old Sony mp3 player. I heard a lot about power amp and I LOVE IT#33; One thing I feel the standard player does better is the sound quality just seems a bit more "fuller". I tried playing with the EQ setting in power amp and got it the best I could for my set up. I believe the real difference is in the DSEE sound enhance feature that Sony has. Would it be possible to add this to power amp down the road for Sony players? Also any way to make use of the walkman button on the side? Rather it load up power amp than the stock player.

new poweramp version, problems in using	Hi, since the last few days I have a new smartphone (Samsumg Galaxy S3). Thats why I have also a new version of Poweramp. Now I have starting problems. 1.

In the folder "Artists" I can only see the albums and there is no "All Songs" button, as it was in my previous version. How do I change this? 3.

exclude a folder from shuffle	My standard settings are to have Poweramp operate with shuffle set to all as this turns my player into a large random jukebox. The problem is that I have things like pod casts as well as general music and currently there seems to be no way to flag the areas I would like to be excluded. Currently the only option seems to be to add all my music to a play list, which would take a while and have to be done everytime I add a new set of tracks.

audiophile or non-distortion mode for eq	Currently the EQ allows for both positive and negative adjustment of levels. Id love to have an Audiophile Non-Distortion mode for the EQ that starts with all of the sliders at ZERO across the top of the screen and only allows for negative adjustments. Increasing levels on an EQ causes distortion in any bands that are pushed above the flat range. It is preferable, and instantly renders better sound quality, to only lower bands that you do not want to hear as much of. By using this mode of the EQ you would also allow users to make more finite adjustments to the sliders as their full sliding area will be dedicated to only the negative range. This idea struck me after realizing that there is really no practical purpose for moving your sliders above flat. Its just wasted real-estate. I do realize however that many people who do not understand how EQs work are used to being able to boost things and will not react well to having this ability removed. For this reason I think it would be a great option and not a default.		08 April 2013 - 04:22 PM	Sproketz

Sure I could use the library view, but as it doesnt support album artist it is useless to me and so I have to use the structure of folders. By the way, my folder structure looks like: Music Albumartist ( are sorted alphabetical and should stay so) albums ( are sorted alphabetical and want them to be sorted by year) songs		31 March 2013 - 01:14 PM	Sirion	[Erm, given that folders dont have ID3 tags, just names, how are you planning to sort them by year? (unless you put the year as the first part of the folder name, which is what I do with a couple of artists, but then youre still sorting by folder name). Folders do have createdates, but thats nothing to do with the songs in them, its just a system date. Andre];[But what about using the ID3 tags of the songs inside the folders to sort them by year? Or something like a text file which is placed inside the folder (like the AlbumArt.jpg) and gets recognised by Poweramp.];[The Folder sorting order does not care whats inside the folder, thats for the file sorting level to use. Why not just do what I do and put the year at the beginning of the folder name? Sorted (if youll excuse the pun).];[Because it would cut off my synchronisation settings in my home network and it doesnt look elegant (sorry, no better word). It shouldnt be a great issue to have a detection of a special file (as mentioned it works with AlbumArt.jpg so why not with another file?) to acquire a special sorting.];[I guess you need to decide whether Folder sorting is really what you really want then, as folders are Android filesystem items, not music data, so they arent tagged with music tags like MP3 files are. If you want to sort by music tags, the Library option might be better suited for you.];[It would be if it supported Album artist.];
times played for trackssongs	I love Poweramp and its the only one Ive found with Left-Right balance option that doesnt suck, but it doesnt keep track of how many times each track has been played, like with Apple products and many other apps. Please include this, it would be very nice to see		03 April 2013 - 03:10 AM	Sduibek	[You may sort tracks by most played in Poweramp by tapping on Library icon in Poweramp main screen, then tap on menu button and choose Most Played.];
full screen mode for album art	I would like to be able to select a full screen mode for album art. I have a 10" Transformer and I travel alot. It would be nice not to see any controls visible and the cover art as large as possible to take advantage of the large screen. Swiping to the next song would still be possible. A tap in the corner would bring back the controls. Thanks		02 April 2013 - 11:34 PM	gremlin	
embedding downloaded album art in id3-tag	Hi there,I really love the sound quality and style of Poweramp. Nice work#33; Almost all my mp3s have an embedded album art. (I used droid3tagger) But I prefer the CD-Cover (Single) over the album art for some of my songs. So I deleted the album in the ID3-Tag and search the CD-Cover through Poweramp. Works.But whenever I restart the player or edit the ID3-Tag the old embedded album art shows up again. (Yes I checked "prefer downloaded album art over embedded") For the future updates:Is it possible to embed the downloaded album artsingle art directly with Poweramp? It would take less time than using foobar2000.Its super nice that you can download album arts through Poweramp. But its a pity that the downloaded album art neither is embedded nor saved somewhere you can export it.		19 June 2012 - 03:47 PM	wurstt	[Thats something Id also like to see implemented#33;];[Is there really no one else who want this feature? If not, then Ill have to spend maybe 1 week to embbed the every CD-Cover-Art for every song by my own...no Im not joking -.-];[I made an account just to +1 this. Its great that Poweramp can download missing album art and I can casually set which one I want...however the fact that its not then embedded into the ID3 tag is disappointing#33; It would be great if there was a click button to click to embed the art into the ID3 tag permanently#33; Thanks];[+1000 for this#33;#33;#33; Using 2-3 apps at the moment to get the job done... (Not Poweramps albumart though).];[I am with you guys and totally agree on this. I am a new user of Poweramp and was blown away with features it has. I have been using player Pro for my music for past 4 months. Its good decent player. But I think after trying Poweramp I would say it is more refined player than PlayerPro at least to me. Here is why I can say that. I dont know if anyone have felt this but Poweramp equalizer is more effective than PlayerPro. I still use both though. my Fav Poweramp now. Well back to the point. After using PlayerPro amost 4 months I started looking for some change. The reason for change was exactly what this post is about "Embedding downloaded Album Art in id3-tag" Poweramp does same thing what playerpro does which is by not embedding downloaded Album art in id3-tag. I think it would nice if you please add this feature in next release or sooner. This will save a lot of time for updating album art. I am not regretting a all by purchasing this app. In fact, I am glad that I have made this purchase. You know what ? It sounds better. Shhhhhh...];[Well see what we can do for you guys#33;];[Yes please. Also to wurstt, how do you use foobar2000 for album art? Ive been trying to figure that out forever.];[I am using the trail version on my s3 right now and i loving it.

beats audio compatability	Hello, I have been a fan of power amp for over three years and it has worked flawlessly. I recently upgraded my phone to the HTC droid DNA. I have been having a couple of issues with the lockscreen widget Woking at all times when unlocking the device. Sometimes it will show, and other times it wont. But what I am most importantly conerned with is that when I am playing music through power amp and beats audio is enabled, I get a message telling me to turn it off because power amp isnt yet compatible with "beats" audio. Do you know when it will be?		29 March 2013 - 04:25 PM	taynerik	
clock position on lock screen	Wonderful app - best music player Ive tried (and Ive tried loads)#33; Just one tiny niggle - the Lock Screen. Is it possible to have the clock at the top of the screen with the artwork immediately below rather than side by side?

the back button	Let me know if anyone agrees with me on this. The back button takes me back to my homescreen, but all Android phones have some type of homescreen button already on the phone. Would it be possible for my back button to take me back to the previous page? Heres an example: I click on Artisis A Day to Remember All Songs The Downfall of Us All If I wanted to go back, Id have to hit menu, then repeat the same thing over again to get to the band where instead it could go: The Downfall of Us All All Songs A Day to Remember Artists Thanks, nklenchik		18 November 2010 - 12:20 AM	nklenchik	[Thanks for the request. Back button navigates to the previous activity if youre in now playing list. It navigates to previous artistsalbumlibrary etc if you first navigated to such selection through the FoldersLib. 1. I.e. player (or 4x4 widget) = press on mini display = shows now playing listselection = back = returns to player. 2. Player = FoldersLib = Artist = Album = songs list = back navigates to Album, then to Artist, then to Library, etc. If you press ^ header while in now playing list, youll get to the parent list and back button will work as described in #2.];[Idk why, I just cant seem to get it to work for me. Whenever I hit back it takes me back to the homescreen if Im in player mode];[Sorry, where do you go to home screen from? From main player ui with big album art?];[Oh wow I just noticed I can go back by pressing below the album art awesome];[I have to agree, the behaviour of the back button is kind of strange and counter intuitive throughout the UI. Allow me to differentiate between two different methods of navigation - one being "up", as in going to a higher level. Examples include album song list artist library or player playlist And "back" being "return to previous screen" When in library#092;folders, the the title operates as "up", but I dont think that the back button should operate as "up", since users are used to that button acting as "back" in the flow. The back is usually used to revert to a previous position in the flow. For example, if I navigate to an artist album list, then "up" to artist list and change my mind, it would make sense for the back button to return to the artist albums list. Another example is if Im browsing my library and going over some songs in a playlist, while a different album is playing. If I press player, then since "back" takes me to the homepage, the playlist I was at is "lost" and I have to find it again and navigate to it in order to get back to where I was. So in conclusion - I really feel that the back button should do what its meant for, go back to a previous screen as this is consistent with my user experience and android UX in general. Every screen already has an "up" functionality (pressing the title, pressing the song name in player etc), so theres no need for the back button to do that as well. Also in player UI, no reason for the "back" button to go to homepage. If you could fix this, or at least include an option for this Ill be eternally grateful. It makes sense, no?];[Another example of inconsistency: Main player press song title Playlist press "back" Main player (good) However Main player press song title Playlist press title (albums) press "back" Library (and not "playlist") So.. I stand by that "back" should do "back" and not "up"];[Thats what Im saying haha. Theres no doubt this is an awesome media player, one of the best if not THE best. Lets do all we can to keep it that way with updates];[2 vyathThanks for the feedback.I described it here: viewtopic.php?f=3t=229#p844 ,but again, - when you press the song title, the current playing selection is shown. Most of the time you dont want back button to navigate up into hierarchy here.- when you are in the libraryfolder by other means (just browsing), the back button will navigate up to the hierarchy.There is no problem to change that back button behavior with (future) options. Though Im not sure what you guys would prefer Back always navigates up into hierarchy?Back always navigates to previous screen?Actually it can be option to select from these two + current default behavior for back.Thanks!];[Thanks for the quick reply, max! I love the fact that youre here listening and conversing with your users. Best 5 Ive spent recently!I think both me and nklenchik agree that the back button should do what its meant to do, go to the previous screen - as theres always a UI button on the screen that allowes you to get up the hierarchy.Its important because "back" allows you to "change your mind" and double back on your decision making process. And you know us, users - were always indecisive I want to stress how important this is for the usage flow:One of the key aspects of good UI is consistency. Dont get me wrong, your software is incredible, and most of the time you got it right where all other players (and android apps) in general got it wrong, but I believe the inconsistency examples Ive illustrated show why its important to "have the software do what the users expects it to do". Ill give another example.If you navigate from album to song list, then press back, you DO return to the album (because in this case, "back" and "up" are the same thing), and so this creates the illusion for the user that the back button does "return to previous page".However, if you go the other way around - navigate from song list to album (via the title bar) and press back - then you return to the library screen.So again, I feel you should always have the option to go both up in the hierarchy as well as back in the flow. Up would be using a UI button on the screen (and every screen already has that already) while back would be using... well the "back" button BTW,if anyones interested theres a really good article about flow and UI design:http:www.joelonsof...0000000249.html];[Thanks for the detailed description again. The back behavior is always consistent (return to something previous), except for the only one case: when you press the song info and get into now playing selection. Then if you click UP header youll get to the some library artistalbumfolderetc. From now on the back button mode will change to "up to hierarchy". In other cases it returns back to what you were at: - Main UI - playing now list - back - main ui - Main UI - FOLDERSLIB - artist - album - songs - back - album - back - artist - back - library - back - main ui. I could disable the behavior change when user presses the UP header and goes up to the hierarchy. The only problem here is that its unclear why back button navigates back to main ui, while in library it usually navigates back to previous list.];[Ok I think I see what might be a bit confusing. When I said consistent I meant between usage of the back button in android, not specifically to your app Let me try and clarify - *Sometimes* Up and Back are the same thing but not *always*. In this case that you mentioned: - Main UI - FOLDERSLIB - artist - album - songs - back - album - back - artist - back - library - back - main ui. so here Up and Back (previous) are the same thing (because you always come from a higher hierarchy) But consider this case: Songs -(click on title) Album In this case, where were at the album screen - "up" is not the same as "back" Up - would be going to Artists Back - going to songs (where you just came from) This is the expected behaviour... In the other case you mentioned: - Main UI - playing now list - back - main ui Yes, that is exactly what that back button should do! (return to previous screen. that is net necessarily up in the hierarchy) And the title should still do what it currently does, go up in the hierarchy. What do you think?];[I will do the back button configurable with the following options: - always return to previous screen (like your described) - always navigate up in hierarchy - return back or navigate up in hierarchy depending on context (as its now) Thanks!];[I need to bump this topic. I just downloaded this app, and its great, but vyath has described perfectly the issues I had with it, and then some. Mainly the back button functionality and the part where: browsing for a song (song list) now playing press back button does not bring you back to the song list you were browsing, but just back to the song list of the current artist. These issues seem to have not been fixed as far as I can see, nor have I found an option for back button functionality. Is this being worked on still or did I miss something? Thanks! Droid X user.];[Sorry, this is non issue. I described it in details in previous post. "browsing for a song (song list) now playing press back button" - this will return you back to home screen (if you mean main PowerAMP screen with album art by "now playing"). This is of course if Main screen is the startup screen. Its possible to make library list as primarystartup screen, then it will return to the list from main screen.];[Thank you for the reply! I changed the startup screen to last played folderlibrary list, and that works better in terms of remembering where i was browsing if I let the screen time out. However, Im still unclear about how the back button behaves sometimes. For example, if you go into Poweramp while a song is playing then this is how it behaves: Now playing - press back button - android home screen (which was the previous screen) However, back behaves differently if you go up in the hierarchy just once, as follows: Now playing - click on title - press "All Artist Songs" (going up in hierarchy)- press back button. In this case, the back button press and all back button presses thereafter will continue to go back up the hierarchy. However, if you dont press "All artist songs", the back button behaves differently: Now playing - click on title - press back button - now playing. In your post before last, you mentioned the back button being configurable... but I cant seem to find that in the options. Did I miss something? Thanks again!];[o my word it always annoyed me when i pressed back and it went home , i thought i was the only one definitely an option to add];[Agreed, I think Back should go back to previous screen (and also not need to be pressed twice in order to get back from folder view to the player screen). Home button should go to Home. Andre];[In folderlibrary view, the back button should NOT up the folder tree. It should go back to the player window#33;];
master pause iconbutton for bluetooth playback	Hello, Well done to you for creating this already excellent player Here is a suggestion to overcome a small issue, that Im sure others may have experienced: Would it be possible to incorporate a master pause button in Poweramp and its lock screen, that overrides bluetooth AD2P control commands "Play " without interfering with the phone function? Normally when driving with bluetooth selected on the car stereo, Poweramp will start playing. I am able to view the artist info and use steering wheel controls to select next track. If a phone call comes through (car has hands free kit built in the stereo), Poweramp pauses then resumes at the end of the call. This works nicely. If I have navigation software (navigon) running at the same time, the voice from the navigation blends in over the music. The audio level for this can be adjusted independently. There are times when driving I dont want any music, however still wish to use the navigator (navigon) and hear the directions over bluetooth. The problem is if power amp is manually "paused" it immediately starts playing again. If I quite Poweramp using the task manager, power amp will automatically start up again and resume. The only way to overcome this is to make a audio track called "silence" and tell Poweramp to repeat that track. There are no options in the car stereo to pause a "bluetooth audio player", the only time it will pause is when receiving a call, listening to cd or radio. Turning the volume down in Poweramp unfortuntly has the effect of reducing the navigator audio level. It appears Poweramps volume adjusts the "master volume", rather than having its own independant control. I would have though a master pause IconButton would work, the bluetooth audio channel is shared (phone calls are also channelled). This master pause, could be cancelled by hitting the next button on the steering wheel, should you decide a little music is in order after all#33; What do you think? Thanks Jonathan.

video suport for music videos (flv) on album art	Hi, first things first, congratulations on making the greatest portable music player, theres no other one near. Mainly I use Poweramp on my galaxy note 2 and razr as a monitor for my sony bt car stereo, and the sync is awesome, media butons work as expected and even prints the id3 tag of the current playing song, Im happy. But, my music library is mainly built of flv music videos and when played trough Poweramp it wont show either albumart or the video, this is expected as is not a video player, I know, my suggestion is to let Poweramp (as an option) play videos on the same area as the album art as a background, i will not be ment for watching movies (so theres no need for advanced video or subtitles options) but confortably enjoing music videos, not even fullscreeen is requested,		26 March 2013 - 05:44 PM	angelistick	[Video is Video, it does not matter if it is a music video or not and Poweramp does not support video playback.

I would like 1 ablum with the correct name, and the 2 discs tracks inside. Thank you];[No answers cause this feature will not be implement ?];[Reviving this topic as Ive started experimenting with various aspects of Poweramp before I purchase. Im looking at various ways to transcode my music collection from FLAC to m4a using a supportable folder structure. Will use dBpoweramp Batch Converter to do the transcoding, which gives me a couple of options: 1) Like other posters above have, the most natural way is organizing according to artistalbumtracknum-trackname. In the case of multidisc albums, dBpoweramp can automatically create an artistalbumdisctracknum-trackname structure, which can be helpful in case I need to re-rip a particular CD. dBpoweramp detects multidisc albums by reading the DISCNUMBER tag; if there is an xxxx set of numbers there, it registers as multidisc. 2) Alternatively, I think it would be possible to set variables such that multidisc albums are put in artistalbumtracknum-trackname format, where the tracknum is a concatenation of discnumber-tracknum (so that the first song on the second disc of an album is numbered 201). Now the original tracknum tag will not be rewritten (nor should it be), so my hunch is that Poweramp will not handle that correctly from a library read, and the first tracks from both discs of a multidisc album will be played one after the other. Anyhow, I copied a set of tracks from a multidisc album to my phone. The critical tags are Album (the same across all tracks from both discs), Discnumber (e.g., 12, 22), and Track (e.g., 1, 2, etc.). When I go into Library in Poweramp, I can drill down into the Artist, and I see two instances of the album (same name), one of which is Disc 1 and the other Disc 2. What I think SHOULD happen is that a multidisc album is displayed as a single album, but the ordering of the tracks therein should proceed from those on disc 1 to disc 2. This would provide the best playback experience for that album. Is this something that can be built into Poweramp, assuming proper track tagging? Thanks!];[I have mine set the same as Genki: Artist#092;Album#092;Disc Opeth#092;Blackwater Park#092;Disc 1 Opeth#092;Blackwater Park#092;Disc 2 Some sort of split tree view might be a good solution. Could be complicated though, so Im not in a huge hurry to see this, but it would certainly be nice.];[Just an interesting note: when uploaded to Google Music Beta, albums organized as Griffs, Genkis, and mine are handled correctly.];[Mine is similar to this.

composer and year	Hi, First of all, thanks a lot for this excellent application. I am using it with my Galaxy S and it works like a charm.

Really appreciate that you are looking into each of the request and trying to implement them whenever possible. Thanks for this nice app and the support.

Composer has been a standard ID3v2 tag for quite some time, it should be straightforward to add, as well as other standard tags (year, albumartist, ...)

The next sophistication is to be able to organize ones music collection as desired, ID3v2 is a standard that allows that, but so few players recognise that. Go Poweramp#33;];
albumt art and artist pictures	First of all I would like to thank you for great work because Ive been looking for a good music player for a VERY long time and finally this app does *almost* everything that I looking for . Following are few thing that I would like to see added that will make it ultimate player (at least for me)- Show artist picture when browsing by Artist (just like when browsing by album)- Option to display albumartist pictures in Grid layout.- Automatically download artist pictures.- Ability to select artistalbum art manually (out of the downloaded pictures). All these features currently exist in Music Player Pro for Android (but it lack all the EQ functionality of Poweramp.)Keep up the good work.		02 November 2010 - 12:39 AM	ajamils	[Hi, thanks for feedback and requests.

smooth menu scrolling (like zplayer wp8 zune app)	Hello Poweramp forum, Recently I downloaded a cool Android music player called ZPlayer that recreates the UI experience of the WP8 music player (found on Windows Phone devices).

remote control of poweramp over network andor bluetooth	I would like to be able to control Poweramp from a remote device (pc, other tablet, other phone) over the network. Preferably with an advanced front-end applet on the other device. Currently I have connected a low cost Android tablet to my AV-receiver through HDMI.

equalizertone dial request ideas	I may sound like an idiot on this one but I have two requests or ideas.

browse by genre...then by artist....then by album.	Hi there. There are a few scattered posts here and there regarding adding an update to the app that would allow one to browse by genre, then by artist (without having to see all the albums), then by album. This is an aspect of music browsing that hardly any Andriod app offers, but has been a standard on iOS since the beginning and its one of the things I really miss. I love everything else about Poweramp, but what would make it perfect for me is to offer this, since I basically always browse my music by genre. its pretty annoying to have to scroll through the list of all the albums each time (and the current alphabetic scrolling in Poweramp doesnt work, even when the list is sorted by artist, because its still paying attention to the album names, not the artist names). In other posts, the developers have said that this was a feature planned for version 2.0, but it hasnt made it in yet. Any updates on whether this is still in the works? Thanks#33;#33;		06 March 2013 - 03:01 PM	jdevgrell	[This is the only reason I purchased a different player from the store. Gonemad does genre browsing very well.

sort playlist by play count	Hello, it would be great to have the feature to sort a playlist by play count. I know the function "often played" in the library but this is not what I want.

ignore articles in lists	A feature that would allow us to ignore the articles in song titles, albums, artist names would be appreciated. As it stands a lot of my songs are clumped at "the".

hearing music and incoming calls problems	Hi there, I am very satisfied with the Poweramp App. Best Music-Player in Play-Store#33; But, there is a "BUT"... Something this is annyoing me pretty much and I am over 90 sure, that this wasnt the fact in earlier versions of Poweramp: When I am hearing music via headphones (without a microphone or other fancy stuff) and a call comes in, the music stopps, I unplugged my headphones, answering the call and when the call ends, the music suddently plays on with or without the earphones are plugged in again. So, when I am not fast enough, everybody can hear my music very loud, before I am able to reconnect the earphones. That is embarrasing, especially when I am on the crowdy train to work or somewhere in public. So I had turned off the option now, to start the music again after call. But then, I have to restart the player, what is not so embarrasing but still annoying. As far as I can remember, that werent a problem in earlier version of Poweramp. There the music was paused untill I reconnected the earphones after a call. So, my request is, to reimplement that very nice feature again#33; I am using a Samsung Galaxy S 1 (GT-I9000) with Android 2.3.5.

eqtonebass per track	Just an idea.. I have a lot of different tracks which, in my opinion, need slight different EQTone etc settings to each other.

awesome beats mod compatibility	There is this popular mod that ports the libraries for Beats audio into other devices, called Awesome Beats, such as this one for Nexus 7: http:forum.xda-dev...d.php?t=1889522 I know that for Beats to be enabled in Poweramp, it needs to be turned on in the ToneVol settings tab, which wont show up unless it is on HTC devices. Do you think it is possible to show this button on non-HTC devices as long as the libs are present? The mod is popular enough that it is ported to many devices. Im pretty sure this will please a lot of users.		26 February 2013 - 11:40 AM	inScythe	[Well test it on our device and, if it what it stands for (binaries looks like Sense 3.0 beats, but Play-available Nooz dsp from the same dev comes with a binaries in APK not ever usedloaded, just for a "weight" - so thats why it should be careful checked) , will enable it.

poweramp + player pro	I like power amp but you could take some stuff from player pro, like album info and internet search for lyrics.		26 May 2012 - 08:13 PM	Shadymugen	[We already have internet search for Lyrics... Just not well implemented, but were working on that for Poweramp 3.0 Also what do you mean by Album info?];[Poweramp is definitely the superior player. The only feature I could imagine from Player Pro is the Artist Picture. Maybe you could implement an option to download artist pictures automatically from a specific server or select the pictures manually.];[Im in the same boat here. Ive paid for Playerpro, but its player hasnt been fully updated in forever. Ive been trying out your player and I love it#33; THe only thing that I see mising is the lyric support I so loved in playerpro. Im sincerely missing the option to either going into the menu and search in the app for lyrics then being able to save them; or just long holding on the image to get a mini menu with lyric search in it. I see above that you are working on this for Poweramp 3.0, and I would love to try out the beta for that when you get it out Ill be buying your pro app here very soon.];[The User Interface of PlayerPro is something that Poweramp could get something from. While Poweramp is definitely superior in terms of customization and music, the UI is in my opinion still not as beautiful as the UI of PlayerPro which is just simple, clear and intuitive, while the UI of Poweramp is "just" intuitive. I would wish for a few features including:Artist Pictures in the Artist Menu (as with Album Covers)Background Picture for Lockscreen (maybe use the Artist Picture or custom pictures)A more direct connection to Google Now#33; (instead of starting the search function in Poweramp directly play the ArtistSongAlbum)Those would be my wishes for the future which i hope can be included sometime in a future release. I hope that someone can maybe answer if any of these features are already in the works or at least planned in the near to far future, since Poweramp is my favourite music player#33; =)];[Thanks for the requests. Better layout and more options for artistslock screen is definitely in the works for 3.0 release. As for Google NowSearch integration - this is focused (by Google) on standard media library, Poweramp has separate one (to support all those additional formats, which are just non-existant to stock library), thus, searching with Poweramp integrated results causes massive duplications, though, well probably enable this too for 3.0.];
mono or panbalance control	Another feature that would be really helpful and often gets left out of player controls is the ability to control the stereo mix. My brother cant hear out of one ear so whenever he listens to headphones, he only gets half of the mix. Would it be possible to work a balance or pan control into the EQ settings? Or to make an option to combine the stereo channels into a mono mix? Thanks again.		15 December 2010 - 07:36 PM	tempist	[Thanks for the request. Ill be looking into adding this.];[Thank you!];[I second the request. It is perhaps understandable that this is often overlooked as an important feature for anyone with unequal hearing between left and right ears. It is especially important in mp3 players (most dont have it I believe) and music player apps for phones. My hearing loss in my right ear is getting to be just enough that when I listen to music through my earbuds, the sound seems a little off center biased to the left. Maybe from those years of playing guitar standing in front of an amp in the 70s I know Im not the only one. A balance control would make Poweramp so much more usable by people with asymmetric hearing and even make it the preferred choice. If you add this feature, you should emphasize it in the features list. Us poor boomers are entering the years where slight hearing imbalance can make earbud listening much less enjoyable unless it can be compensated for with a balance control.];[Also requesting this. As far as Im concerned, this is a necessity for a powerful media player. Would definitely come in handy in correcting imbalanced headphones.];[I made a request similar to this one. Being able to control the channels of each song. viewtopic.php?f=1t=693 there Theres a program called audacity that I use to manipulate the tracks by splitting the mp3 into two parts than on the bottom half, invert the audio and switch both from stereo to mono, to cut out the lead vocals and some bass. Really cool and great for creating instrumentals out of the original tracks, depending on the song. Some songs work and others sound scratchy.];[I definitely would like this feature to, i like to share ear buds before football games or just listen with one ear so i can hear surroundings, so mono would be an awsome feature. cant wait til its implemented.];[Id also find this feature really useful. I use Poweramp to listen to music at work, but just plug one earphone so I can hear if anyones talking to me, or my (desk) phone rings.

Its just cant be added quickly as some layout changes are required (there will be also gapless and crossfade controls). Thanks!];[Is it possible to add channel balance? It would be great for me;) It is the only one thing missing to say, it is 100 perfect program];[viewtopic.php?f=3t=438#p4222 Thanks!];[As a person with zero hearing in my left ear, I would love this too.];[Loaded your trial. Great product, didnt have the ONE thing I was looking for: a left right balance control. I have a special need, I sing 4 part harmony and learn my parts from learning MP3s that have my part (baritone) on the left and the other 3 parts on the right. In the process of learning, I start with the balance control to the left and gradually move it to the right. However a balance control is a feature that many people with unbalanced hearing have been asking Apple to put in the iPod for years. Please email me when this feature becomes available! Thanks much.];[Dear developers, Further to previous discussions, allow me to input a small comment. To be perfectly frank, people with unbalanced hearing account for slightly less than 100 of the population of our planet. Most earphones available are not entirely balanced either. The problem is that for the majority of uses who notice that, only a minuscule adjustment is needed. Moreover, in most cases this adjustment needs to be done once and forever. This is why I believe that a circular knob is (1) unnecessary, because it is supposed to be used extremely rarely; (2) not accurate enough due to the relative roughness of finger motions combined with the screen response tolerance. I suggest that a menu item be added to allow the user to input a numerical value, say, -100 to 100. The greater the range, the better. This solution will save screen space too. I strongle hope you will find my suggestion useful.];[Me too on the balance control. Half deaf in my right ear.];[Yes! This would be a welcome feature for all audiophiles, as all professional sound systems for the home has this feature.];[Dear Maxmpz, its been two months since you said "soon" - and we dont have any sign its in progress or scheduled for any reasonable time. By no means am I trying to pressure you, but I just feel I need to re-emphasize the importance of this issue, because its related to the very basic function of the player, which is listening to music. I hope for your understanding of the fact that we experience this problem each and every day, every single time we turn the music on. The inconvenience is physical. And its really hard to keep on waiting without knowing when or if this is going to be resolved. Thanks, mate. Youre doing an exceptional job anyway.];[any update on the balance control? thx];[Hi, Id also like to request that it be possible to swap l and r channels for people, such as myself, who sometimes have to wear their earphones backwards (for using the mic), or for other people who have their heads on backwards (we all know people like that).];[A mono switch and balance control are now in Poweramp 2.0 my one working ear thanks you];[The balance control is a good start, and is the reason I downloaded this app, but I need it to completely cut out traffic from the left channel when its cranked all the way to the right, and vice versa. Thats how my stereo works, thats how my car works, etc. I need it, as many others do, for some acappella learning tracks. Language tracks also often use the L-R tracks discretely. The guy who said to enable mono after balance (I.e, play only the right track via both channels) would also be a killer feature#33; Think about it.];
volume slider on main screen and bookmarks	What really would be nice is (as the title says) a volume slider on the main screen, next or under the album art. That would be specially useful for people who use Poweramp on tablet with really small, half-hidden buttons (Im looking at you, Motorola Xoom). Also, a bookmarking function could really be interresting when you listen to audiobooks with Poweramp. having to remember that you left at chapter number 676436, 59.35 minutes an really be annoying.		23 February 2013 - 05:12 PM	kystos	
volume knob on main screen	Im a reasonably new Poweramp user - best player Ive used. Straight up, one of the options that I liked the most about Poweramp (versus others that I demod) was the fact that it had a large volume knob. My feature requestion is this... ...on the main player screen, I could care less about album art. I would LOVE to be able to have the option to place a large volume knob on the main player screen in place of the album art would be just fine with me.		20 February 2013 - 05:21 PM	troyamiller	[New guy here, supporting that idea 200.];

When you press the Walkman button a function called "VENDOR1" is activated. This function turns on or off the Walkman app. I have modded my Walkman button into the MUSIC hardware key.

my requests	HiIt#8217;s done, I finished my 14 days trial period today (with build 512) and I bought Poweramp just after receiving the end of period notification without hesitation I tested several players and Poweramp is my favorite by far, however I#8217;ve some requests that I would like to be implemented in future versions: - Manage #8220;Album Artist#8221; tag. Already discussed here. In album view we should be able to sort Album by #8220;Artist Album#8221;. This sorting must prevent to concatenate Album with identical name but different Artist (ex #8220;Greatest Hits#8221;), or to see #8220;Various artist#8221; in case of Compilation CD. This is clearly a Must have A specific view should be available for #8220;Album Artist#8221; similar to #8220;Artist#8221;. Should Have Note: folder view may help for the time being but in my view it#8217;s an unsatisfactory solution - Improve Navigation amp; Ergonomy I find the global navigation a little bit #8220;messy#8221;. For example I#8217;m not found of having the possibility to get direct access to folder view at the bottom of the screen when you have chosen library. Should Have. Instead I would have preferred to be able to access genre and artist views. Swipe right or left should be implemented to change from one view (ex Album) to another (ex Artist) Should Have In landscape mode, on play view, I#8216;d rather have the album art in one side and the control buttons on the other to see larger album art and better screen usage. Should Have On play view if you want to go back to complete album list you have to press on #8220;album icon#8221; first on bottom of the screen, then back to album arrow "lt;" on top of the screen. Not very user friendly. See also #8220;note#8221; just after Note: It may be a bug but I noticed on play view when pressing long on #8220;album icon#8221; a context menu is displayed. If you press album view you go back to the song list of the album instead of complete album list. Shoud have - Grid view Enlarge slightly the picture. To save space beetwen album arts Insert text (Album amp; artist name) over the Album art instead of below (or offer the possibility to completely remove the text). Should have . Offer the possibility to customize the number of Colum or define the size of album art. Nice to have - Keep Screen On Additional condition should be possible : Keep Screen on only when connected to power supply Should Have - Language Make French available (It#8217;s not an issue for me but could be if you want to develop your product in France). Should Have Is there someone that already work on the French translation? Or do you need Help? Skin I use free ICS skin but I#8217;d like to have a Jelly Bean skin. Quite similar actually but one difference I noted in Jelly Bean is the sceen background has a dark grayblack scale instead of pure black. Nice to Have Lock Screen Change slider to ICS or JB fashion.

cover flow	One of the coolest features of any music player is cover flow - a horizontal, scrollable list that shows the current album art as well as the album art of the previous and next songs. I love the Cover Flow from Google Music and a similar feature would be fantastic for Poweramp. It would go where the album art currently is. In addition, the cover flow could also show the currently-playing (and next) TitleArtistAlbum information in line with each album cover (as seen in the picture below). Or, you could keep the tradition info display and just use the cover flow for album art images. http:i1125.photobu...05-21-04-49.png		06 February 2013 - 05:13 AM	oneillperson	[Here is an example of what Im thinking of (Photoshopped): http:i1125.photobu...owerAMPidea.jpg];[I really like your mockup#33; I quote the idea of inserting a cover flow in Poweramp; it could eventually use the 3D cover-art animation already present in the "normal" view of the player...];[I prefer that it is kept the way it is.

search window	. Currently you need a second click to call it up. I also find useless to show a search bar with the previous search text; every search is virtually a new one.

Thats exactly what happens on my device (Samsung Galaxy S Plus, Android 2.3.6). And the previous search text is highlighted (so you can overwrite directly or modify your last search string). IMO the perfect behavior.];[Ok, I read what you say and I think it can probably be now considered a bug : In portrait mode the search option is in the option menu and it works correctly. In landscape mode you get a search button and this is NOT bringing up the keyboard. Can someone confirm what I am saying. P];[I can confirm the same on my S3. In portrait mode, Search opens with keyboard active and the previous search-text highlighted. However in landscape mode, Search opens WITHOUT the keyboard active, but still with the previous search-text highlighted. You need to tap on the text-entry area to get the keyboard to pop up. (By the way, does anyone else hate the way that Samsung phones overlay their own massive white text-entry top-screen for many landscape text entry fields, rather than continuing to allow you to type into the actual field on the form you were originally viewing? The screen on an S3 is plently big enough for it not to do this, but I cant find an option to permanently disable it) Andre];
multi window feature of samsung galaxy devices	Hi, I hope by next major Poweramp version, that Poweramp would have official support for the promising "Multi Window" feature found on Android 4.1.2 and higher of Samsung TouchWiz Galaxy devices (S3, Note 2, Galaxy tab).

reverse playlist setting	There are a lot of options to deal with playlist order, but it seems to be missing the most basic one plain reversed.

edit tags improvements	Seems like itd be a great feature to have the ability to edit general pieces of information about your music such as Artist and Album titles, without having to click on each song and changing it individually. Personally, i get music from a wide variety of sources oncluding iTunes, datpiff, and livemixtapes. Occasionally, album titles are messed up, being typed in all caps or spelt wrong, whatever the case may be. So i try to keep my library as uniform as possible and this can take up a good chunk of time, depending on how many songs there are and the degree of editing i have to do. Maybe when you hit the arrow thing next to a song and tap "infotags", youre given the option to change multiple or just that one, using a checkmark as a selection tool.

play once setting for musicians and theatre use	Many musicians andor theatre sound engineers need an audio player that has a setting of quot;Play Oncequot; (or sometimes called quot;Play Pausequot; or whatever). For musicians, this feature is used to hit Play on a given quot;backing trackquot; and then the musician does NOT have to frantically hit Stop when the song finishes. Rather, when the song finishes, the play simply stops and waits for the musician to select another song and hit Play. For theatre engineers, its more for queuing up sound effects and when you play one, the player STOPS and waits for the theatre engineer to select another sound effect and hit Play. The concept is quite simple. When viewing a list of songs in Playlist mode or folder mode or whatever, when the musician hits Play, the player goes through the song and when it reaches the end, the player completely STOPS and is basically waiting for the user to do something (such as select another song, etc.). Creative Labs has had this feature on their .mp3 players for years. Musicians would love this feature, and, when combined with all the other wonderful things I have seen within Poweramp (replay gain, treblebass, EQ, etc.), I think youd have an instant hit with musicians who use quot;tracksquot; for live performance.

Im a magician and Im specifically looking for the ability to have the player pause after the current track finishes AND the ability to fade to a pause when the forward button is pressed. Im frequently using music when selecting an audience member to assist and I dont know how long the music needs to run. I need it to fade smoothly to a pause if needed AND the ability for the song to just stop at the end for my set routines. My wife has it on her iPod Touch (PlayMyQ-HD) and thats what Im using right now... but Poweramp is a lot more robust and Id like to use it with my Samsung Galaxy Player instead. It would seem to be a fairly easy option to implement. Pause after current track... whether the track ends on its own (or) if the forward button is pressed.];[Thanks for request Folks.];

features to support listening to mp3 audiobooks....	My public library makes MP3 audiobooks available on CD-ROM, but my cars CD player doesnt read them. So instead, I port them over (temporarily, of course) to my Android phone, and use Poweramp to play them through my car stereo. Heres where the problems begin: 1) Poweramp insists on "temporarily" naming each track with the name of the book (the album), and I have to access the track number via the INFO button. Inconvenient at best, and dangerous to have to do all that while Im driving. To be clear, the information is still there, but Poweramp wants to display OTHER information to me. If it could display the TRACK NUMBER, both in the overall track listing as well as in the title window when the program runs full-screen, this would be a great help! 2) Now Im getting picky: I have a few books stored on my Android device, as well as many, many albums. I would love it if you would allow for "Bookmarks" to be created, so (lets say), Im 4-12 minutes in to track 65 on "Book XYZ," I could log a book-mark, then go to the gym and listen to music while I work out, and then go right back to the bookmark when Im back in my car driving home.

playlist position memory	I want the Poweramp app to remember the last song played when swapping between playlists. So when I switch to another playlist I want it to resume playback from the last played song and not start at song number 1 as it currently does. I basically want the same functionality the Adobe pdf reader app has when managing pdf documents. It keeps track of which page was the last read on each and every pdf and goes to that page whenever you open the pdf and not page 1. My playlists are getting long and it is a huge nuisance to have to listen to the first few songs when swapping between them. Moreover, one playlist may be the chapters of an audio book, then it makes even more sense to be sure to continue from where it was last time.		01 November 2012 - 05:04 PM	Dr.Ipred	[Bumpeti bump.];[Right on#33;];

night modedimming mode	Essentially I use Poweramp as my Music Player when my phone is docked in my car. I absolutely LOVE the swiping feature when I want to change tracks while driving because it is eyes free. The issue I have with it is when I am night driving the background colors (behind the album art and the album art in some cases as well) specifically get pretty bright. What I would love is quick button or an option to turn on a quot;Night Modequot; which would dim the screen (Like both my GPS and my CarHome Ultra do). This will make it much less distracting while I am driving. Currently at night I am forced to use the shortcut buttons (this means no swiping) in my CarHome Ultra because it at least has a night mode and is much less distracting while driving.

couple of things to make poweramp the best music player#33;	So, I have a few suggestion for Poweramp 3.0. Firstly, the app needs to come together a bit better in terms of transitioning between folders, library and the player. Whenever I hand my phone to a friend they never have any idea how to get out of the music player (w. the album art etc.) and into my library to look through my songs or artists. And the back button just exits out of the app. The only two ways are pressing the music note button in the top (very faint, doesnt shout LIBRARY to me or anyone else I know or pressing the name of song (just below the big play button). Secondly, I experienced this bug running 4.1 and 4.2 on my Galaxy S II and 4.2 on my Nexus 4. When using the new holo fast scroll thing for artists or songs it jerks around randomly if I just scroll normally (slow-scroll). That definitely needs to be fixed. Also, a more unified lyricsalbum art feature would be really nice, like if you could record 10,000 songs and have your own database of lyrics and album artwork that is 100 and if someone requests it, it always suggests your perfect set of lyricsalbum artwork. Although, it should require high corelation between the titleartist before syncing. A nicer settings layout would be nice, maybe break it down into just 3-4 categories when you press settings. (not very important) Increased cmpatibility with winamp would be great too, or itunes but thats probably pretty hard given its apple. Another bug is that since I upgraded to my Nexus 4 (4.2) the swipingswitching between songs is very laggy, like ill swipe or press the next button several times before it actually does anything. Not laggy in terms of FPS; it just doesnt switch the song even though everything is still smooth. This might just be a jelly bean bug like the other one. Thanks#33;		05 January 2013 - 05:11 AM	phyr3

magnatunejamendo integration	I really enjoy using Magnatune and Jamendo ... these services have their own apps already, but might there be a way to integrate in some way with Poweramp?		04 January 2013 - 04:02 PM	tjoko-veltman	
a-b repeat feature	Hi,Does Poweramp feature an A-B repeat function?Support for A-B repeat in Poweramp would be awesome. The ability to mark a start and end point within the single songaudio file that is played for just that marked-in segment to play recursively would be great to use especially for playback of audio recordings but also for musicAdditionally an ability to exportsave the particular bookmark file (text )of the A-B repeat that is selected for.Many of you might have used the feature on such players such as VLChttp:forum.videola... ... 2amp;start=20(Its in VLC 1.0+)		21 December 2010 - 07:00 PM	haddy	[No, PowerAMP cant repeat part of song at this moment. Thanks for the request.];[Ok, do you plan on this feature for the future (say after v2.0)];[Any further info from you Max on this? Consider it for 2.xx ??];[Its not going into 2.0, but may be into 2.1. Thanks!];[Thank you, yes by "2.xx" I meant v2.1, v2.2 etc.. much thanks Max long live PA 8-)];[Would be awesome if this could somehow be squeezed right into the last thing todo for 2.0 release.You see the A-B feature usually requires "a" and "b" buttons to mark in and mark out (look at VLC media player) - so what I suggest when preparing to implement this feature is to make another separate screen for it. Just like how EQ+Volume dials have their own screen, the A-B should have its own screen too which would feature the basic playbar of the currently playing track, no album art, but large buttons for "A", "B" and "X" buttons (X for cancel).Also the ability to export as many custom A-B repeats to a text file for later again uses (a button with a floppy disk logo). Export A-Bs individually by track and by album.];[Thanks for the details, haddy, it will be useful.];[You can also take a look at an android application called (ironically) A-B Audio Repeat. It would help provide an idea of how this function is being used (but Im sure that Poweramp would do a much better job with it as Poweramp is a MUCH BETTER app than that app.];[Or perhaps A-B repeast should be a separate plugin that max could release? http:forum.poweram...es-in-progress];[Im interested too...

radio style crossfade	This idea is not my own, but I have heard hardly any comments on it when mentioned on earlier occations, so I thought it might be time to give it a thread of its own. The idea. Normal crossfade: track one is close to end and starts fading out while crossfadeing to track 2. Track 2 is starting on zero volume level and is fading in during crossfade. Radio crossfade: track one i close to end and starts fading out. Before track 1 is completely silent, track 2 starts playing at normal volume. The good thing is that you get a nice crossfade without missing the initial tones of every track. Happy for comments#33;		12 February 2012 - 12:13 AM	huheeje	[No comments on this? I think its a great idea#33;];[Excllent idea. Would make a good Crossfade option to Poweramps existing crossfade];[I was searching for this very suggestion before posting a new thread... Rockbox can be configured to do this (by setting the fade in duration to 0) and it would be great if PA added this as an option... as such, I dont use the crossfade option at all because I dont like how faded in songs sound. Radio style crossfade is a good, descriptive name btw.];[I definitely agree. When do you implement a configurable overlap function? Pleeeeaaaase];
disable crossfade by genre	First: I#8217;ve had an Android phone for a while, just bought a car stereo with built#8211;in Bluetooth audio streaming last week. I figured I#8217;d give the trial version of Poweramp a go because it keeps showing up as highly recommended in the Android Market. I bought the full version after about 10 minutes of trying it out #8212; the combination of Poweramp plus Bluetooth streaming is *too cool*. Plus I love all the extra features you wouldn#8217;t necessarily expect like crossfading, FLAC amp; ReplayGain support and album art downloading. I tend to just throw all my songs into one folder and listen to them on shuffle, crossfading from one to the other. I like just about every genre of music so the result is rather eclectic. Crossfading works really well for most of what I listen to (which is pretty #8220;beat heavy#8221;) but some genres don#8217;t hold up well to crossfading #8212; punk songs, for example, don#8217;t have much of a lead#8211;in or #8211;out and there#8217;s not a lot to fade from or to. So, my feature request would be to allow the ability the user to choose genres for which they#8217;d like to disable crossfading. Thanks, and keep up the great work#33;		28 November 2011 - 05:34 PM	dsb	[A genre depending overlap andor crossfade would also be helpful for speech, radioplays and comedy tracks. I agree with that. The crossfade only and no overlap is the weakest point on Poweramp.];
crossfade changeble	Hello#33; Ive just downloaded Poweramp few days ago, and was amused about its crossfade function, but i want to suggest a little bit feature request, that might be helpfull: let users change crossfade duration from 0 (not 1000ms) to end.(15000ms). And it wold be great if i can change it manually, by keyboard, not by slider (as now). I think, that its would be very helpfull for some users and me too#33; Thanks for great player and sorry for my English (im from Moscow, Russia).		04 November 2011 - 04:49 AM	asmol	[I agree#33;];
feature request: crossefade (fade out, not fade in)	Hi, LOVE the player! I really like the new crossfade feature, but I cant help thinking that if you make it optional for it to automatically does now (with the cut our of silence at the end of tracks) and then start the next song on top of the end of the previous one WITHOUT it fading in, it will give the radio-ish feel. I miss the beginning on every song the way it works now. Not cool. If you only fade out, and start the next song full blast over the ending, then it will sound much more right to the ears. Hope this is possible. I really appreciate the work youre doing, and it is great to see how thriving this forum is. Sincerely, Kingkeld.		05 May 2011 - 03:48 AM	kingkeld	[I completely agree. This is the best music player app out there. I have tried enough of them. I like the crossfade feature, but the player takes it literally (crossfade = fade out the playing song, fade in the new song). This can stay for those users who prefer this method. I would like (prefer) to see an option to overlapmix as Kingkeld mentioned. Fade out but begin the new song at its full volume. Ideally, use silence detection, or a look-ahead buffer, during this process rather than a set "ms" amount so that if a song ends without a natural fade-out, wait for the end of the playing song before starting the next track. If the current track fades naturally, overlap it with the start of the next track. With that, IMHO, the app would be priceless. However, with its current list of features, it is still the best. Thanks, Mike];[Kingkeld, I just read your post regarding the fade-in issue, and I found a setting that eliminates it while at the same time retaining the fade-out feature. Go to the Poweramp "Settings", them scroll pretty far down to "Auto-Advance and Queue". Then select "Start Playing Queue", and finally select "Immediately". Success at last for the true music buffs!!!! Regards.];[Kingkeld, I made this adjustment and it really seems to solve the fade-In issue. Access the Poweramp "Settings, scroll down to "Auto-Advance and Queue", scroll down to "Start Playing Queue" and select "Immediately". Its enough of an immediate play of the next song in the queue to make a difference for us music buffs. I do notice that about one out of 10 songs, even with this adjustment, have still slightly lower initial volume and some fade-in, but I can live with that ratio until Max eliminates the fade-in all together. I hope this helps! Regards, NoSpinHere];[Hi mikeb1028 and NoSpinHere, Im eagerly waiting for this feature, too. But I cant find the quot;Auto-Advance and Queuequot; settings youve described in my Poweramp.

space recognition in title tag	Hi there, Lovin the Poweramp#33;#33; Thanks for all the hard work on my favorite app#33; I have a huge classical music collection which I have organized such that I have 5 spaces at the beginning of many of the track (and file) titles (I literally press the spacebar 5 times before entering any characters). See below: Unfortunately, Poweramp, to the best of my knowledge, doesnt recognize all the spaces. The app simply uses one space (instead of my five). Is there any way to incorporate this into the next updatebuild? Would be most appreciated - thanks#33;		29 December 2012 - 08:18 AM	BeeSee	[I didnt think it was valid to have spaces at the start of filenames at all, I would have expected them all to be removed to be honest. ID3 tags may be a different case though. Could you maybe use something like underscores instead? Andre];
lyrics plugins - alternatives needed	I can get MusixMatch to work to identify songs on tv etc on fewer than ten per cent of times that I try. Given that, if you have Poweramp installed, MusixMatch is too fat and useless an app to have on a phone at the same time, there should be some allowance for alternatives, other than just entering the lyrics oneself manually via editing tags.		22 December 2012 - 08:49 AM	RustyRiley	[Im strongly agree with you.

changing tags on actual mp3 file	Few requests. 1) Some songs that I buy online have the wrong genre. For example, Christmas music listed as miscellaneous, or soundtrack, or pop. I found out I can modify the genre tag in power amp, which is fantastic. However, it doesnt change the genre tag in the actual file. Reason that I suspect this is that when I open the song in other music players (Google, Amazon, HTC), the original genre still shows up. Its there a way to add function of permanently changing the tags? 2) Can you add theme that has white text instead of neon#092;fluorescent? Thanks for this great program, that Im sure can only get better and of course sell more as it gets better.		24 December 2012 - 04:52 PM	ksefteri	
poweramp for windows 8 phone	Any chance of a Poweramp App for the Windows 8 Phone OS? Pleeeeeaaassse? Both media player solutions currently available(nokia music and xbox music) are rudimentary pieces of garbage that does everything on training wheels. It also leans way to heavily on cloud based solutions. I miss the control and slick UI of Poweramp on my old Android. Id definitely pay again for Poweramp Full if there was a Windows 8 Phone version. Windows 8 is a pretty dope OS but I think it should trust it users a bit more and allow more granular control of the UI and media features.		26 November 2012 - 02:11 AM	Peaceful	[Ditto here. What needs to happen to get Poweramp on Windows Phone ? Money? Programmers? Would love to participate in getting this going.];[Another request here for Poweramp on Windows Phone. (Phone 8 for me) I just switched from my aging android phone to a new Windows Phone 8. Nice OS but the stock music player needs some love.

documentation	Unless I have failed to find it, what I miss is documentation. This is the first portable music player I have every owned (yes, an old fogy loading his phone with classical music), and while I am enjoying the music, I am also puzzling away on how to use it. eg. Loading a playlist (it showed up but said not loaded when I imported via isyncr from sons itunes on pc). I have that working. Any of fancy settings allow me to compress dynamic range? (forever adjusting volume as music switches from solo instrumentvoice to full orchestra). Can I switch from playlist to playing a specific sound and then go back to the playlist in the same position? (I suspect this is something to do with queuing??) Any way to quot;shufflequot; but keep whole pieces together (ie dont regard a symphony movement as a separate song). At the moment, the only I can find to do that is use an audio editor on the pc to collect the whole piece into a single quot;songquot; and import that. etc. Took a while to discover the hold-down function on shuffle. All things a manual might help with.		01 November 2012 - 03:04 AM	pscadden	[I agree. I put myself in the same category.

For quot;player uiquot; I have auto hide panels amp; show track counter on. Equtone is greyed out due to the setting in quot;menusquot;. RepeatShuffle icons amp; Rating are set to hidden. This keeps the album art clean of icons and makes the height of the player controls a bit bigger. Setting Album Art Zoom to 1.08x fits it to the width of my screen. This leaves a small bit of the background colour showing above and below the album art. Not bad. This is all in portrait btw, holding the phone landscape totally changes all of this.];[I have to say that I really like the color change in the background and even I would like it to be all around the screen. I mean for me the request would be the opposite. So, its better to have a switch to turn on or off the glow. I like it a lot and I think its one of the most important difference of the UI of the app. Regards, Leonel.];[I have tried all the defailt themes and two paid ones, all have this background and I would like the option to turn it off.

poweramp without album covers..idea pics inside...	I am one of those people that dont use album covers for my library....I hate seeing the Poweramp logo all the time..I would like a feature to remove the album covers on portrait and landscape.I would like to see a bigger display for song,album, genre and artist...I did some photoshopping on my idea...here it is....		05 December 2012 - 03:06 AM	pachi72	[Also would love to increase or decrease the scolling rate of tag info..];[I see your point. I think you are in a very small minority regarding not wanting album artwork though. Can I ask why dont you like seeing album artwork? Is it just because your library doesnt have the artwork, or you just dont care for it (artwork)? If its just because you dont have artwork, you could always use Poweramp to download the artwork for you (Settings gt; Album Art). One possible solution, which I have the feeling you wont like, is to make an image you dont mind seeing all the time and put it in every folder. Then in the Album Art settings, enable the Prefer in folder art. It would be excellent to have the option to disable artwork entirely though. I too would get sick of seeing the Poweramp logo. Not that its bad, but if its taking up all the quot;real estatequot; unnecessarily, then yeah, I can see it becoming annoying. The more options the better, which is what Poweramp and Android in general is built on. IMO.];[This can easily be done via the creating a SkinTheme for Poweramp. Perhaps a minimalist (no album art) skin such as this could be included as a choice to use within Poweramp itself...Amongst the other preloaded (non-default) choice of skins that come with Poweramp];[I also would like to have the ability to disable the view album cover, but also a choice of tags to display (like year) during playback.];[Further to that, we could have them as animated flying text (like the Galaxy S3 Live Wallpaper) in place of album art, see this video; .....This would be super cool within Poweramp as an optional minimalist but stylish theme.

vst wrapper: maybe a pipe dream, but i#39;d pay extra for it.	Besides a couple minor quirks with the way Poweramp handles metadata, theres only one thing that I really would like to see change in Poweramp: the inclusion of a VST wrapper. As a Foobar2000 user, theres a number of VST plugins that are nice to have, but one that is essential. Terry Wests ReLife does the seemingly impossible job of automatically repairing a lot of the damage done through heavily-compressed masters. It does a better job of analyzing and simulating the original waveform than anything Ive ever used including dedicated programs like DeClipper. The best part is that it does so without needing to re-encode the file or micromanage the process per song and its completely free. The ability to load VST plugins into Poweramp would be a dream come true. I know making a VST wrapper would not be a quick and easy thing. But if you somehow found the time to make one, Id happily pay a premium, even more than the cost of the app itself, to add it in Poweramp. Theres no music player on Android or iOS that can do anything remotely like what ReLife does and the difference is simply stunning.		12 December 2012 - 08:33 PM	Icculus	
activity for startingstopping playback	Id like to have activities for starting and stopping playback.

customizing the #39;repeat#39; and #39;shuffle#39; modes	Hi, I would like a way of customizing the Repeat and Shuffle modes. I just want to use the three standard Repeat options.of Off, Repeat single, Repeat all (list) I really do not need quot;advance listquot; in the Repeat and I find it annoying having to see it when I toggle through the various repeat modes when playing a track in Poweramp. But this is just the way I feel and it should not infringe upon other users who may use the quot;advance listquot;. So it would be nice if we could customize what we want to show for Repeat and Shuffle but always have the same method (option) of reseting these back to their defaults. Same should exist for Shuffle too. A good place to add this requested feature would be within the transparent Menu that shows when we long-press on Repeat button or long-press on Shuffle button		08 December 2012 - 04:31 PM	haddy	[A while back (I think quite a while back ) Max agreed to make the whole Repeat menu more logical and self-explanatory - partly as no one really seemed to understand what quot;Advance Listquot; meant for example, and also for users who were asking for a way to play just one song. The terminology went something like this: Play Song Play Album (or artistfolderetc) Play All Repeat Song Repeat Album (or artistfolderetc) Repeat All As that makes quite a long list, I wonder whether he might also agree to adding a simple tickbox option within Settings to select while of those choices (and maybe which Shuffle options too?) appear in the cycle sequence? Just a thought anyway. I like your idea of long-press on the icon to always bring up all the options though.

amazon cloud support	Hi, Amazon have just launched their Cloud Drive for music in the USA (https:www.amazon.c...amenuacdlrn2). Although Im in the UK, but I predict that Amazon will extend this service to their non-US sites (eg. http:www.amazon.co.uk) eventually. Could you support streaming music from Amazons Cloud? Im not sure how realistic this idea is. Or even if Amazon will open their Cloud API. It is something to think about anyway.Thanks, Tim		29 March 2011 - 08:50 AM	ChilliDemon	[Hi, it purely depends on their API and licensing. If both are permitting, it would be possible to add support for this.

when screen is off, should not turn screen on.	Maybe there is a setting i missed on, but when i am listening to music on the go and want to change the volume in my pocket, the screen goes on often resulting in unwanted switching of songs or any number of other things.

#34;resume on headset connect#34; setting behavior	Hi there, first of all thanks for a wonderful app#33; Right now, if I check setting quot;Resume on Headset Connectquot;, Poweramp will start music playing every time when I connect my headset or headphones. And it gives me a little bit pain, because I want application to continue music playing if I accidentally disconnect the headset, but sometimes I connect headset for other reasons except music listening (movie watching for example). And I dont need automatically music playing start in such case. I think it would be more convenient if application would start music playing only if it was interrupted by disconnecting of headset before.		04 September 2012 - 09:55 AM	Wronglink	[Im sorry but to honest, I dont think this is a feature we can add to Poweramp since its loved and used by manyincluding myself. It might be better off, in your situation, to simply turn off the auto resume feature, and add Poweramp to your homescreen... That way when you plug in your headset you can choose to either turn on music or not.];[First of all, thanks for this app#33; (ONLY Android App Ive ever bought ) I would like to make a suggestion concerning people who are using headphones without playback controls (broken controls, studio headphones, etc), just like me. Basically, what I want to do is to turn the plug unplug action into a play pause control. However, I dont like the idea of keeping the headphones unplugged just to keep the music paused - but just like the OP, I dont want music to start playing immediately when the headphones are plugged back in. So heres my proposal: Would it be possible to resume the sound only on an even number of reconnects? 1. Headphones are currently plugged and music is playing2. Headphones are disconnected - music stops.3. Headphones are reconnected - music doesnt resume.4. Headphones are disconnected - nothing happens.5. Headphones are reconnected - music finally resumes (back to state 1)];
poll let#39;s have a file browser in poweramp	Hi I would like to propose having a File Browser in Poweramp. It would work similar to the way an Android file manager works in that it can browser the systemsd card for folders and files but instead within Poweramp it would be filtered only be able see all supported audiovideo file extensions for immediate on-the-fly playback within Poweramp. Rationale for this proposal: 1.) Ready to use on-the-fly playback 2.) Not all users use or have familarty with creating playlists 3.) Avoid having to use a 3rd party file manager.(potentially triggering Poweramp app crashes) 4.) Able to more accurately locate and playback files from inconsistent locations such as USB connected drives (especially with USB OTG support on devices like Samsung Galaxy S3, tablets etc).5.) Easily access and playback files from Folders of music which have not been user added to the Poweramp Library. 6.) There are a few reasons why a user may not want to add (scan) a particular folder of music to Poweramps Library. One of which might be content. 7.) This would help complete Poweramp as an all round super music player. Poweramp already has support or planned support for ad-hoc things such as Lyrics, podcast streaming, online radio, cloud, ratings, tag editing..The list goes on. All of which are preliminary supported or schedules to get future support in Poweramp. An internal basic File Browser for Poweramp would really add benefit. It would display only Filenames and no tag data or anything else, strictly filenames only, similar to the Poweramp All Songs view: Such a Browser if implemented, should be accessible from both within the Poweramps quot;Libraryquot; selection view and also available as an optional quot;Startup screenquot;. Maybe some basic file management actions such as Rename, Batch Rename, Delete, Copy, Move, Share etc could be considered although these are not important. If not considered then this Poweramp quot;Browserquot; would be a strictly read-only explorer.

bookmarks	What is the latest plans for incorporating audio bookmarks into Poweramp? Planned to be added in the next couple releases?		15 March 2011 - 11:39 PM	GaryMO	[Im curious about this, too. I was kind of hoping PlayerPro had a bookmark feature cooking for their 2.0 release but they didnt. I know this feature was suggested a while ago here, and it was said that there was a possibility of having it as an optional plugin any updates? (Sorry, Im impatient but I dont mean to sound pushy It just sucks using two different players with two different widgets on my lockscreen.)];[If you would, please give us an update on this. Several folks were asking for this capability a while ago. You seem to get back very promptly with other questions from users. BTW, I am a paid user. Thanks.];[I found bookmarks really helpfull in other audio players when listening to podcasts and audiobooks. So please give us this feature!!! Also the another feature that would be nice to have, the player distinguishs between music and podcastsaudiobooks, using track time, then it dosnt play them when you shuffle all tracks. Please give use this aswell!!! Thanks];[For whatever reason, max does not want to respond to this Bookmarks post, but Ill keep bumping it up to the top until he does.];[This feature is useful for audio book players and not appropriate for music player like PowerAMP, but Ill be looking into adding it as option. Thanks!];[Could bookmark save not only position in the track, but also track number in playlist?];[Max I agree, it would be useful for audio books, but I also use Poweramp to listen to alot of hour long podcasts, so a simple bookmark capability would really be nice, IMO.];[This is something I would like to see also: to be able to bookmark the particular song (and position in that song) in a given playlist. In this way, when I move over to another playlist, I can come back to the original playlist and resume listening where I left off. I would like this feature because my playlists tend to be audio courses. Sometimes, I listen to several audio courses (each in a separate playlist) at a time, so I would like to be able to resume each course where it left off, and not have to restart it each time. One suggestion for implementing this is the following. In the list of playlists, when you select a playlist by touching it and holding it down 2-3 seconds, you presently get a menu with: Enqueue, Play All, Shuffle, Delete, Add to PL, Rename, and Del Dup. Simply add another button titled "Resume".];[Status on this?];[Whenif this awesome feature is implemented I will immediately buy full version. Even a plug-in with the bookmark feature I would pay for. Thank you for considering.];[Thanks for the request.];[Bump. Anything new with this request?];[This is an often-requested feature (see this current thread and also (1), (2), (3), (4), (5) for other requests). I understand that you intend for Poweramp to be a music player, but what a developer intends something to be used for and what people actually use it for are sometimes two different things (take, for example, the Nook Color, which was intended to be used as an ebook reader but people have modified to act as a cheap Android tablet).Please reconsider this feature request. Im not a developer, but it doesnt seem like such an overhaul to add something simple like a timestamp to a database for files in folders named "Podcasts," "Audiobooks," or even "Mixtapes," checking that database when switching files, and seeking to that spot in the file if anything is in the database. Certainly it doesnt seem like it would take as much time as Im sure getting gapless playback to work properly did (it took Apple years to implement gapless on iPods). The Poweramp trial overall gives me a good impression, but the lack of bookmarking support is a deal killer for me.];[Save your breath. He chooses to not respond to this request, for whatever reason. I guess if he gets the urge to make this simple feature available for folks like us that listen to long audio files, it will be there on one of the future updates. If anyone has come across another player (free or paid) that does a good job of bookmarking, please post it on this thread.];[I disagree, its an important feature when listening to music through playlists and when alternating playlists - if we include the playlist position in the definition of a bookmark. For example, I listen do different genresartists in the morning on the way to work and in the afternoon on my way back. Playlists are longer than my commute time and I manually delete from the playlist the songs I already listened to. This way, after listening to another playlist I can return to the previous one next time.The irony is that Poweramp already has bookmarks - just one, the one that remembers position if you exit the application. All is needed is UI. "Folder Playlists" in the Library View can be merged with "Playlists" (how does it matter where the playlist was created from - from folders, search results or library?) and replaced with the new Bookmarks item. In the Player view, the Ringtone button can be removed (who is using it other than hip-hop listening teenagers - can be moved to the List view) and the Bookmark button can be there in its place.Thank you?];[Looking for bookmarks for long audio tracks here too please (mainly for podcasts for me). Any news yet? Andre];[[quote name="crimper"]The irony is that Poweramp already has bookmarks - just one, the one that remembers position if you exit the application.

Lets keep it up near the top.];[Sorry to see that this thread has had no input for so long so have joined just for this post. I would dearly LOVE to see a bookmarking feature for audiobook and podcast use. Having tried many audiobook apps, none seem to play the range of files types that Poweramp does and certainly dont have the ease of use (and good looks#33;). Its very frustrating to see something that ipods etc have done with ease for years, has still not been accomplished on the Android platform. If needed I will give my left *** (but would rather not).];[I absolutely agree with ThAtGuY7326. In my head I always had a automatic Audiobook Bookmark System as my old Sansa Clip+ had, but a manual one would may be even better.Additionally the shuffle thing is also a thing. I have two Audiobooks on my phone and their file amount is equal to my music files. When I shuffle all the songs, half of the time Im listening to Audiobooks.thanks for considering our request.];[Yes, I definitely would like this feature. So true, iPods have done this for a while. On an iPod you can actually stop listening to an audio book halfway through, listen to an hour of music, go back to the audio book, and it resumes right where you left off. Brilliant.];[+1 its one of two features worth paying for and motivate to switch from free apps 1. Gmusic support - so people who use that can switch for G music app 2. Bookmarks - so people who are using mort player];[I want to voice support again for this since its been a while. Has your stance on this changed at all, Max? Also, I wanted to point out that the new music player named RocketPlayer by the iSyncr guy has gapless playback and podcast bookmarks, and the dev is working on an equalizer. PlayerPro has added podcast support via playlists (although this is a less-than-ideal solution since it doesnt group podcasts by the same artists, its a start). They may both start to steal PA customers for this reason.];[I registered just to help out on this: First, regarding adding to Power Amp, yes it would be cool, but it would probably fall prey to #2 from this blog post: quot; 2. Dont get sweet talked into building a truck. You should immediately triage the feedback and feature requests you get into two broad buckets:We need power windows in this car#33;orWe need a truck bed in this car#33;The former is, of course, a reasonable thing to request adding to a car, while the latter is a request to change the fundamental nature of the vehicle. The malleable form of software makes it all too tempting to bolt that truck bed on to our car. Why not? Users keep asking for it, and trucks sure are convenient, right?Dont fall into this trap. Stay on mission. That car-truck hybrid is awfully tempting to a lot of folks, but then you end up with a Subaru Brat. Unless you really want to build a truck after all, the users asking for truck features need to be gently directed to their nearest truck dealership, because theyre in the wrong place.quot; source: http:www.codinghorror.comblog Secondly, the UI is much different for the needs of a power music player and a audiobook player. Different functionality. Try SmartAudiobook Player https:play.google....audiobookplayer It has meet my needs perfectly and is free. I think the developer is doing a good job maintaining proper focus on what Power Amp does best. thanks,New User.];[Well thank you so much for your input New User. Storing at least the last-played position for longer tracks (whether those be classic music, podcasts or audiobooks) is a pretty basic need as the current navigation tools are rather clumsy for anything beyond fairly short songs. Also the option to skip those sort of tracks from shuffle lists would be very useful too. But I agree that theres no need to make Poweramp a full audiobook player per se. Nice to know you are happy in your world anyway though. Kind Regards, Andre (very experienced user, and long-time beta-tester)];[I see where youre coming from, but I have to respectfully disagree with how youve applied the blog post youve cited to this request. I think that this feature is more the quot;power windowquot; feature as opposed to the quot;truck bedquot; to which the post refers. If the request were for a full blown podcatching interface such as in BeyondPod, Doggcatcher, or Podtrapper, then Id be inclined to agree with what youve said. However, adding bookmarking is hardly a quot;fundamentalquot; change of the program. As for the UI, I dont see how it is much different - a playpauseskip button are pretty standard; the only minor difference that I can think of would be the possibility of a quot;short rewindquot; button. In fact, if I remember correctly (its been a while since Ive used my iPod Touch) this is the only difference between the podcastaudiobook UIs and the music UI on iOSs music player. As Andre said, its nice to know some users dont want this feature. But seeing as how this thread is marked quot;Hotquot; indicates there is at least mild interest in it, even if its just a downloadable plugin or module to the program. quot;It is not the strongest of the species that survive, nor the most intelligent, but the one most adaptable to change.quot; - Leon C. Megginson, paraphrasing Charles Darwin];[For now, just a simple option to remember the last-played position for any file longer than (say) 10 minutes would be a very welcome step indeed. Please? Andre];[I created an account just so I could bump this up. Over a year later and nothing. Its kind-of disappointing that the Dev has decided that people shouldnt be using his app to listen to podcasts or audio books. No one wants to have to keep multiple audio programs on their phone instead of just using one that does everything they want. Not because it was a difficult feature to include, but because the Dev is simply opposed to the idea of his paying customers using non-music audio files in his player. You know, there are music podcasts as well. People that listen to DJ mixes often have audio files that are over an hour or 2 long and would like to be able to get back to the spot that they left off at, even if they listened to other files since then. Or is the dev opposed to people listening to DJ mixes in his player as well. Maybe I should find a 3rd music program for my electronic music.];[+1 on this request#33;];[According to Wens answer, it should be included on next major version : http:forum.poweram...iobooks-please But i +1 this topic too. Audiobook support (with bookmark, chapters support) is a long waited feature from users over the forum. It would be nice if Max do an official statement about it or add it to the planned TODO list.];[Ooops - so disappointing to see my only remaining wish for Poweramp being ignored already for so long. I just moved from Windows Mobile (yes - so late) using Conduits PocketPlayer there and it took my also some time to get them conviced how useful such feature (playlist resume) was. Sad, sad, sad - such a great player , but this missing feature is a deal-breaker for me. Luckily I just found quot;Just Playlistquot; - a very basic player, but THIS one does exactly what I need. Will stay with that until Poweramp catches up.];[I found a very nice alternative which after only one day has proven itself. Smart AudioBook Player (30-day trial, #036;2 purchase) will remember where you left off. Also, I moved all non-music content (talk radio, audio books) outside the music folder which has made a lot of things simpler. In fact, I think it is a better way to go. Let Poweramp stick to what it does best.];[Interesting. How well does that interact with bluetooth output and control when Poweramp is also installed? Poweramp normally runs for me when bluetooth connects, as in the car sometimes Ill want to listen to podcasts, sometimes music. Personally Im not really bothered about all the advanced audiobook stuff, and I otherwise love Poweramp a lot, I just need it to remember where Id got to when dealing with long audio files (concerts, podcasts, audiobooks, radio shows, etc) and ideally also provide better navigation tools to allow you to move around within such long audio files more easily (skip fwd 30back 10 buttons would be great for example). Finally an option to ignore these files when shuffling random music. Id love to know what Poweramps eventual roadmap is for handling longer audio files (not just audiobooksetc, as this applies to long music tracks too). Andre];[With my phone (Samsung GS3 running stock ICS) the last app to receive a headset press is the one that gets the next press. So if I stop Poweramp with my headset, and after a few minutes press start with my headset, Poweramp starts playing again. And both Smart AudioBook Player and Poweramp stay in the notifications, so switching between the two is a breeze. I agree with you that certain features would be nice if you are listening to longer files with Poweramp (equalizer, navigation, play speed, bookmarks, etc). Ignoring when shuffling is the reason I moved the longer files outside the music folder. Smart AudioBook Player addresses all of this.];[+1 for me too.

force expanded notification	Is there any way we could get an option to force the Poweramp notification to always be extended?

virtualizer, real true stereo separation	I would like to request this feature in Poweramp since almost every other android music player out there has it, and it is a must, since many people like to listen to a wider sound when they listen to music. There should be a poll on how many people use the stereo-x feature, since I persoanlly find it useless compared to a good virtualizer. I have to use third party virtualizers for the desired effect, and thus, I need to untick quot;direct volume controlquot; in Poweramp options for the external virtualizer to work properly, making music sound much worse.

three suggestions	When playing a song the android quot;backquot; button should go to a list just like clicking on the song title goes to the list. (It currently goes to the Android desktop, which doesnt seem consistent with how the back button behaves elsewhere). While clicking on the song title (in the single song display with album art) returns to the list, there seems no obvious way to get from the list back to the single song, short of pressing the quot;backquot; button at least 4 times. In this connection, in the single song display the song title and progress bar have two separate clickable areas, song title and progress bar. In the list display, there is also a song title and a progress bar that look very similar, but they behave differently: they are not two clickable areas but one, and they do something different (just clicking once causes the song to restart). I suggest that these be made consistentboth on the single song and in the list there should be a separate clickable area for the song title and progress bar. (I would also like to see clicking on the song title return you to the single song display, but I understand some people might actually want it to restart the track instead. Maybe an option to choose one behavior?) I can play all songs by an artist by long-clicking on the artist. However if I do this 1) The songs are not in any reasonable order. For instance, they are not alphabetical by song, and they are not alphabetical by album. I suggest making them alphabetical by song. 2) When it finishes playing the last track it says quot;list finishedquot;. I suggest that the quot;next trackquot; button should also say quot;list finishedquot; rather than taking me to a song by a different artist (Im not sure if this is a feature request or just a bug). Google Play tells me the app is not compatible with my tablet. I suspect that among other reasons this is because the app requires Bluetooth and my tablet doesnt have Bluetooth. I suggest not making Bluetooth a mandatory requirement to download the app. I know I can still get it from your page but this is annoying.		28 November 2012 - 10:30 AM	arromdee	[I agree that the Back button functionality is a bit odd. The Home button goes to the home screen, so Im not sure why Back should do it as well.

jump to letter	I love Poweramp, but the one area its lacking in is quickly jumping to the part of a list that you want. For example, UberMusic has this feature: Above every new letter in any list (songs, artist, genres, etc.) there is a box containing the letter. You can see it on the left side of the picture that Ive uploaded. Whenever you click this box, it brings up this menu which allows you to jump to any letter. Its a great feature and it actually had me using UberMusic over Poweramp for almost a year, even though UberMusic is no longer updated and Poweramp has infinitely more features. This one feature is just that good. No more scrolling forever, missing your letter, and having to go back. Where this feature really shines though is when youre driving. I dont think it really matters so much HOW you bring up this menu, but it should be accessible easily from anywhere in any list.

play a folder	Hi, Ive just started trialling Poweramp. Is it possible to play all files in a folder (in album track order) without adding the folder to the library first? I have a few folders containing foreign language lessons that Id like to listen to and I dont want to find them among the albums in my music library. Im imagining an interface such as long-touching a folder in explorer and there would be a quot;Play all tracks in Powerampquot; option. This option would only exist if the folder contained audio tracks. Another option would be starting Poweramp and choosing a quot;play a specific folder ad-hocquot; menu entry. If not possible, and if I have to add the folders to the library first, then is it possible to exclude specific genres from the library display? (So I can list all kinds of music genres but not spoken wordeducational) Thanks		28 November 2012 - 02:03 PM	klitos	
remember place in playlists	I tend to create a shuffled playlist of my whole music library and listen to it all over a period of several months. Occassionally during that time I will want to play something outside of the playlist though, and in order to go back to where I was in the playlist I lave to remember which song I was on (eg 6222591 currently) and navigate there manually. Would be really nice if it could remember my last place in ALL playlists, not just the current one. Eg I am listening to an Audiobook (Iain M Banks Surface Detail, excellent in case anyone is interested) but I sometimes want to listen to music at other times from my playlist. I currently use the default music app for the audiobook and Poweramp for the music so that I dont lose my place in either. Otherwise its a bit like trying to read two books at the same time with only one bookmark...		28 September 2012 - 03:58 PM	BT52	[I agree entirely. This would be very useful. It would be further useful if it remembered your track position even if you change tracks or turn off your phone so that when you play the track again it picks up from where you left off. Other players can do this, so hopefully we get this soon#33;];[+1 Ideally with some way to define which types of file this feature applies to - Im not worried about storing the position for 3-minute music tracks (in fact, Id definitely prefer not to) but trying to find your place again in a 2-hour podcastconcertaudiobooketc because youve pressed track-advance by accident is not fun#33; Andre];
lockscreen landscape option	Hi#33; My Name is Douglas. Ive been using Poweramp at least 6 months, in my opinion is the best music player for Android, full of options and also adding new ones according with the availability and common sense, and its just because of this that I#8217;m writing. I was wondering if it#8217;s possible to add a function to the Poweramp lock screen. I have a Motorola Defy, there#8217;s a cardock function in this mobile phone, when you put it in the dock the screen orientation is changed according with the mobile phone position, so when you activate the lock screen function in the Poweramp it only have portrait orientation. However the dock orientation can be both, portrait and landscape, in this case it would be awesome if the lock screen change the orientation for both as the regular GUI does.		27 April 2012 - 04:46 PM	DMTwo	[Love Poweramp.. and would love to have an option for lock-screen-widget in landscape mode];[Im glad another user has the same idea about the lockscreen. I have a Transformer TF300T, and have just activated the Poweramp lockscreen. I have a folio case for this device which only lets me orient the device in landscape orientation when using the fold-back stand. I was surprised that the app doesnt use the accelerometer to determine the correct screen orientation. It would be great if the developers could make this minor enhancement to the product, because I would never have a reason to use the basic functionality of the Android music player lockscreen again. And that would be a good thing.];

volume control via touch gesture (like video mx player)	hope you could implement a volume change which could be controled by a gesture.

beat matching and notfication bar requests	Hi, one of the main reasons I bought Poweramp was because of the crossfading feature. However some songs sound awful when theyre mixed together like this. so it would be awesome if you could add beat matching on the crossfade feature, a lot of dj programs and music players have this option. I would be more then willing to pay again for this feature#33; An other issue I have with the player is the control buttons in the notifcation bar. Theyre really crammed in together, and often Ill hit the wrong button (press skip track instead of pause, which is really irriating when listening to podcasts) I googled this a while back and read how you implimented the x close icon to allow the it to stay pinned there after the music has been paused. I think it would be better if you implimented the swipe to clear feature on ICS+ devices that closes the app by swiping to either side. This three remaining buttons could then be spaced out better. or if not this, at least give some options to customise this, choose which buttons to have etc. thanks		23 November 2012 - 10:51 PM	adsada	
lock screen clock font	Ahoy#33; Very small suggestion feature request... Can we have an updated font for the clock that shows on the Lock Screen (when both Lock Screen and when DateTime are enabled)? I noticed a while ago that the font for the clock is the font used for Gingerbread, and now that Android 2.3 is getting old, it would be nice to use the font for Jelly Bean. An even better user experience would be to have the option to pick what font is used, ranging from Gingerbread to Honeycomb, to Ice Cream Sandwich, to Jelly Bean. But I am sure that would be asking a lot.		23 November 2012 - 12:24 AM	griff

use wma star ratings	With Windows Media Player you have the option to embed the ratings for WMA files in the files themselves. Checkbox quot;Maintain my star ratings as global ratings in filesquot;. That they are stored, I know for a fact, because when I transfer files from one computer to another, they have the same rating on the destination computer and appear in the same auto rating playlists. It would be nice if Poweramp had the option to read these ratings and use them, so I wouldnt have to rate or re-rate them when I sync thousands of files. I used Windows Media ASF View 9 and found that they are stored in the Extended Content Description Object (1194 bytes) with an Attribute name WMSharedUserRating (UTF-8). The index is not fixed because when I changed a file from 5 stars to 3 stars, the offset into the file changed. And the values seemed strange - 99 for 5 stars and 50 for 3 stars but as a DWord, they make sense as a relative value. So here are the decimal values I found 1 star - 1 2 star - 25 3 star - 50 4 star - 75 5 star - 99 I know that finding these values would require knowledge of the structure of offsets and pointers in that file and I seem to remember seeing something like that once, and maybe the Windows Media API might be useful, but even if that is not available a straight search for the UTF-8 string ought to work. However, even if you never get around to an enhancement like this, I still am more than pleased with my purchase.		11 February 2012 - 04:46 PM	wrayx1	[I did find the ASFSpecification.pdf. Its easily googled.];[I would purchase Poweramp if it supported global ratings in mp3s. My trial just expired and I finally uninstalled it with sadness.

Theres a setting that lets you add controls onto the lock screen. Go under settings #62;lock screen #62; then enable ICS lock screen. You dont need to leave the lock screen to use the controls. When a song is playing, you just need to click the power button on the side and the mini-player will pop up with simplified controls on the lock screen. Has pretty much all the features you wanted: skip songs, album art, pauseplay, rating, randomrepeat selection. Works very well as it is IMO.];[Also looking forward to the car mode app. Although I am curious as to why it is an app, and not just an alternative mode or layout directly within Poweramp. For car mode also important to have large fonts for track name, artist, album, track number, and total track number (and album year). In the car, the phone is usually in a cradleholder further from ones face than when one is holding the phone. I need to be able to read the text just by glancing at screen - and usually when there is lots of sun coming into the car during the day.];[Car mode with voice control... am I dreaming too large?];[you can use the widget for the cover, tasker, and desktop visualizer for creating command links];
hide album covers from gallery	Hi, The large majority of my music has album art within the MP3 or the folder. I notice that these take up a lot of my screen in the gallery.

Thanks		18 November 2012 - 01:23 PM	Minesh	[I noticed the same thing on my phone and was able to get the album cover art removed from the Gallery by creating a file named .nomedia in my base music directory.

Im not sure if theres a better way to do this, but it worked well enough for me.];

option to disable some functions	There#180;s a number of functions in Poweramp that I, at least, would like to be able to permanently disable (via an option in the settings), because I never use any of them. That is, I never use any of them on purpose, but sometimes they#180;re triggered by accidental touches either by my fingers, or by the headphone cord - MOSTLY by the headphone cord, that always seems to fall on the worst places possible. So, please add a way to permanently disable, or to lock the state of these options: - RepeatAdvance List, etc - I always use Advance List; - Shuffle - I never turn it on - on purpose, that is; - Next folderlast folder navigation buttons - again, I never used these two on purpose. For context: I always play my music following folder navigation, filename sorting, etc, which is why accidentally turning on any of these options is so annoying. And I have a lot of collections with 50+ files on the same folder, making it a pain to search again for what I was listening... Thanks.		13 November 2012 - 05:41 PM	Tylor@Soyokaze

please improve the #34;first symbol#34; navigation through lists	Hello#33; Not sure if I used the right name for this - I speak about quick browsing through albumartistsongetc lists by sliding finger in the right side of the lists - it allows to browse by first symbol of list items. I think the distribution of first symbols through display height is too straightforward - it supposes that I have items starting with every symbol and I have same amount of items for each symbol. So in this navigation A got first 128 of screen height, B second 128 and so on. But if for example, my list consists of one A item and 100 items from N to Z - first half of navigation height belong to A (only for the single item), and second half to N to Z. It would be so much better if in this case the height would be distributed not between all 28 letters, but only between actually existing 14. Another example is when I got one item starting with 1 and all others are distributed through the alphabet. Even in this case we got first 13 of screen to 1 with space wasted to rest non-existing numbers. The more smarter way is of course 129 for each symbol. Can you do this please? Many thanks#33;		10 November 2012 - 01:13 PM	balauser

compliments, questions and requests	Dear people who made Poweramp possible, I absolutely love Poweramp. Ive tried a lot of mp3 players on my Galaxy S, but this is the best. It also makes my iPod completely obsolete, cause you cannot change a lot in the preamp of an iPod. I do have some questions requests for the makers: 1 Poweramp takes a very long time to startup on my Samsung Galaxy S. Sometimes even up to 15 minutes. I know that a Galaxy S is not the newest of smartphones, but still.... 15 minutes to startup and it sometimes uses up to 85 of my CPU. Is there a way to make everything faster? 2 It is very hard (maybe impossible) to change the name of an artist, album or the genre of an album or artist. As far as I can tell you have to change it in every individual song (which can take really long). Why not make it possible to change the name of an artist or album without having to change it in individual songs? 3 I dont know how to add album art for a whole album when Poweramp doesnt recognize the album. I have always the year in front of the name of the album in stead of just the name (so for example: 2001 Is This It (from The Strokes) in stead of just Is This It). Result is that Poweramp cannot add album art because it doesnt recognize the title. Maybe it is possible, but I dont know how. Can somebody explain me how to do that? Otherwise its probably good to fix that. 4 I like the mono button. But there is a whole spectrum between complete mono and stereo. I would love to see the mono button getting replaced by a slider, that makes it possible to between stereo and mono, to explore everything in between. 5 I would love to see a button getting added that swaps channels. So make the music from the left ear come out of the right ear and vica versa. Hopefully you can help me#33; Cheers, Guoy		21 June 2012 - 08:55 PM	Guoy	[Regarding request #4, if you use the Balance adjustment knob (next to Mono in ToneVol), you can adjust the leftright balance exactly as you desire. True, its not a slider, but its a better space saver and more in line with what most people expect for this adjustment. Hope that helps#33;];[Thanks for your response, but its not what mean exactly. The balance knob makes it possible to make music come only out of the left or or the right ear, or something in between. When stereo is 100 of the music of the left ear coming out of the left ear and 100 of the right ear coming out of the right ear, mono is 50 of the left ear and 50 of the right ear coming out of the left ear and 50 of the left ear and 50 of the right ear coming out of the right ear. There is a lot in between that. I do not want to turn off a whole ear with the balance knob.];[Any moderators who can help me? Thanks#33;];[1) thats not normal. What phone, rom, etc. do you have? Maybe turn of auto scan or something because no way should poweramp take longer than 30 seconds to start... and thats a long time. 2) We are improving the editing system for 3.0 update 3) You can edit the metatag information before searching for the Album art.

horizontal theme suggestion	Hi Power AMP team: I have some suggestion about the Horizontal display theme.

Maybe move the controls to one side (left or right) and have the album art on the other side (see PlayerPro).];[I use Poweramp on tablet in car and I like current layout more. In car most of us sit on the right side so having controls on the left is a problem. Also I mostly use gestures to skip the tracksalbums. Now you have big album art zone so you can use gestures blindly, with proposed layout this zone is halved, also the track progress line is halved. And whats the gain apart from the bigger track name on the empty half of the screen?];[Hello board. The greatness of Google put me right here.

back button should return you to the album list	... if you started playback of an entire album by playing it from the album list. I find an album I want to listen to, I hold and select PLAY. When I want to find another album, Ill press the track name (just below the album art) and it send me to the track list. And then I have to push the back button. This is not very intuitive. So instead, youre forcing me to first press the MENU button, and then I have to select quot;FoldersLibquot;. I really feel that this should be acessible directly from the now playing screen... by a single-click button. Any chance of fixing this?

random album button	My Creative Zen mp3-player has the possibility to map various functions to one of its buttons. Ive mapped quot;Album of the dayquot; to this button.

automatic gain control	AGC (automatic gain control) is a method used to avoid volume fluctuations between tracks. We all have songs that sound too loud, or too soft, but with automatic gain control, all songs could sound at the same volume. It is not like compression, since it scans the input gain in the file, and then adjusts the output gain to match the required preferences. What compression does is to try to mantain the song in certain db level at all times, which causes some minor problems with songs with both soft and loud parts. I saw the other thread about compression, and also saw how admins refused to implement compression due to some problems, including the one I mentioned. So, this is what I say. Implement AGC in Poweramp. Theres another music player in the android market which does have this feature already (as seen in this screenshot), but Poweramp is way too cool compared to that music player (which also has virtualization, unlike Poweramp). I say this because Ive tested it myself, and with AGC, I never had to worry about adjusting volume for one song and adjusting it again for another song ever ever again. Thanks in advance.		01 November 2012 - 04:17 PM	juhn777	[Sounds good to me. +1];[Already implemented see: http:forum.poweram...2313-replaygain];[RG doesnt seem to work well for my library. Ive tweaked it many times, but ended up just turning it off due to quality issues and ineffectiveness. I have alot of files ripped from CD and an ever-growing library of MP3 from Amazon. There is usually a big difference in volume of ripped tracks vs Amazon tracks. I was hoping the AGC might be more user friendly. If it uses the SAME MECHANISM as RG, then oh well. I have been setting the EQ pre-amp as needed and assigning it to albums that need volume correction most. That works, but is cumbersome and alot of work and is subject to loss since there is no way to backup EQ assignments.];[NO SIR, thats not the same thing. See, replay gain only does one of two things: 1) it boosts db for all songs equally (obviously not producing the desired effect), or 2) it reads the ID3 tag to find a replay gain db refference. Problem with quot;2)quot; is that for it you need to first write the tags to the music IN YOUR COMPUTER, WITH THIRD PARTY SOFTWARE, be it Foobar or Mp3gain, or other software. For the common user, this proccess can be confusing, and we all know common people like simple things, so thats why I ask this to be a feature in Poweramp. AGC could perfectly do the same as replay gain, but AGC is automatic (maybe its an automatic replay gain detector for songs?). So if Poweramp could detect the desired replay gain, and aply it to the file tag, then using replay gain would be the same as AGC.So, in other words, AGC does more than replay gain itself.];[Well, I cannot comment on the desire of the Devs to incorporate track album average level analysis into Poweramp but in the mean time If you can mount your phone as a mass storage device you can use foobar to analyse your entire collection while its on the phone and apply tags as and where necessary. This may get around your problem in the short term. Also note, there is a limiting function that you could use to attenuate transients if you are experiencing clipping.];
decoding speed test to find most battery-efficient audio format	If there was a way to measure how fast the player can decode selected audio file, users could make more informed decision on which audio format to use with their devices.

two requests for effective playlist management	Hello all, I have the following two (rather simple) requests which will allow me to use Poweramp as full-scale Tango DJ (***) app. 1. When adding a track to an already long 50+ list, it is real pain to first add the track and then slide it all the way up to the beginning of the list. It wouldve been of immence help to me to have a new button, quot;add to beggining of playlistquot; 2. When you are playing your queue through PA, and at the same time adding new songs, it is quite easy to accidentally switch the track by pressing on it.... and your cozy evening suddenly gets ruined. It wouldve been great if there was a configuration that allows to disable staring new tracks by simple pressing. E.g. an explicit quot;right menuquot; -gt; quot;Startquot;, would be the only possibility to swich the track. (*** Tango DJ-ing is quite different from traditional Disco in that we do not beat-match or mix tracks, but rather chose on a fly a set of four tracks of the same orquesta based on the whole number of subjective criterias from the library of maybe 500-1000 tracks or more, then go to the next set... and so on... This requires quite an effective playlist management app, which Poweramp definitely is, but without the feature No 2 it is way too dangerous to use in real-life DJ-ing even as a backup to the laptop) Thank you very much, IS		24 October 2012 - 05:32 PM	karmadonna	[Like it. +1];
independent eq for single tracks	I dont think this feature exists on any other music player. It just came out of my mind when i was listening to a bassy song, then when im listening to the next track its not supposed to be bassy, so i change the EQ preset. What im saying is, instead of changing EQs everytime you switch tracks why dont we have a feature that automatically changes EQ for a variety of songsgenres?		31 October 2012 - 09:36 AM	Dug

album art image downsizing method	Good afternoon, could please consider looking into changing the interpolation method the player uses to scale down high resolution album art images ? Majority of my music library has album arts in about 1200x1200 and on my GSIII, the downsized images look fuzzy, almost like it was downsized using nearest neighbor method. Could consider implementing something more sophisticated like Spline64 or Lanczos? Thanks in advance, exabyte.		13 October 2012 - 01:48 PM	exabyte55242	[I suspect the problem is something that Max mentioned a while ago, which is that Poweramp scales everything to 500x500 (I think) and then rescales again for the device screen. Its never a good idea to resamplescale images multiple times. Andre];[If this is what is causing the fuzziness problem than it can be solved reasonably easy by making the first scaling step a user setting instead of a fixed 500x500 setting. That way users can adjust the scaling to their device screen characteristics.];
all albums (or all songs)	When you select quot;artistquot; it brings up a list of all their albums. Could you include one for all albums or all songs instead of having to select each album? Its nice being able to select each album, but it would be nice to be able to select all the songs from the artist as well. This app would pretty much be perfect, if it had this one extra feature. I know there is a way to select all songs, but you have to select a song to play, then hold down the song name, then click on artist. This seems to be a fairly complicated, roundabout way.		27 October 2012 - 11:20 PM	jsnf	[yes yes yes, this feature has been requested so many times. why isnt it yet implemented?];
skins development suggestion: use zip not apk	I think an ordinary ZIP compression archive method would be the convenient method for skintheme creators to have. Just like in the Java ME (J2ME) app called KD Player (also Russian)... A typical skin encompassed two files: A.) a .KDI file (a renamed .PNG or .JPG file) - this file included all the skins image contents B.) a .KDS file (a renamed .TXT file) - a text formatted file which held all the coordinates to a skin e.g. which button is positioned where etc On the other hand, for For Poweramp, Id recognize that an equivalent kdi method would not be as in image file but rather as a ZIP file with all the individual image elements inside. Perhaps two separate kdi equivalents each for portrait and landscape view of the same skin. Here is a screenshot from my text editor of a typical KD Player .kds text based file (further coordinates not in the screenshot of course do exist specified for things such as Play button, rewind button etc etc)... Here is a screenshot of a .kdi (renamed to its true file-extension of a PNG - it includes rgb alpha transparency)... Screenshot of resulting skin (from both the same kdi and kds posted above): btw, this KD Player skin used in this example is called quot;Cletic FCquot; and is available here: http:www.easter-eg...insPage11.php So KD Player loads the skin theme by just reading the contents of the kds and then applying the kdi both of which have to be in the same folder. Furthermore each KD Player skin (although not necessary) has a waiting screensplash screen that the skin maker includes and whenever KD Player loads new skin, this screen is briefly shown before taking the user to an Information which gives detailing on the skin author, date of creation, copyright etc which is something to think about as a cool feature when initiating skintheme support in any media player app. I hope Max, Poweramps developer, could CONSIDER implementing an ALTERNATIVE more easier skinning dev style like this as an alternative to the Android SDK XML based method that is already planned for Poweramp. Well, thanks for reading		24 December 2011 - 02:09 PM	haddy	[Thanks for the suggestion, but unfortunately, this wont work so well for Android app theme. This is due to the huge Android fragmentation. You cant just have couple of quot;mapquot;-like images for a skin. You need to have variously sized images for various screen sizes, as well, XMLed details (sizes, offsets) at least for small, medium, large, tablet and low, mid, high and extra high screen pixel densities. And you need all this in the format Android UI understands (i.e. compiled resource files). Poweramp skin SDK simplifies all this in the way, that skin author doesnt need to include and write everything needed for the skin - heshe can just override some bitmaps, some layoutssized as needed, keeping everything else quot;derivedquot; from default theme.];
excluding songs from shuffle	I Googled this feature before and it seems it has been discussed here, so Im basically posting to show there is interest in this feature and any news on it. Basically songsalbumsfolders would have an option to exclude when in shuffle mode. When I myself have shuffle on, Im looking for my more popular or upbeat songs. By no means do I want to just carry those songs though. When I want to listen to that album I want all the songs. Also goes the same for albums I just dont want to hear during shuffle...those albums I have to be in a dedicated mood for. iTunes had this feature for the iPod. Granted I know Poweramp isnt computer application based. Ive fixed this issue by just manually selecting a ton of songs for a playlist.

I had a bad spell with this, though it has vastly improved now it would have been very useful to be able to swap channels around. Some tracks sounded great if you switched channels and awful if you didnt. Better still would be a fourth option quot;track assignedquot; where you could program a track to switch channels, (perhaps with some MP3 tag maybe) no assignment having been made, being normal stereo of course. So the option could be: Stereo Mono LR reversed Track assigned.];[I dont see a field in ID3 for that.http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiID3];
track songs skipping to identify songs least needed for a user	Its a common practice to download whole albums to a phone and add all songs to a play list.However its usual thing that you dont like all songs on an album.But manual removal of such songs can be a time consuming task.And also you dont know from the very beginning that I wont like a song after you listen to it few more times.Therefore you leave all songs.But then, when you listen to a song and dont like it, you usually skip it.Therefore if you track such skip cases for a while you can identify what songs are candidates to be least liked for the user.Once you identify those, you can present those in a separate list and provide user with multi-selection of those and a couple of options (called e.g.):Hide - exclude from playing in all play listsDelete - physically remove song from a storage (its good to save storage space)Clear skip history - can be useful While I dont pursue any specific implementation of the identification algorithm I would like to provide a sample algorithm description.ff (favoriteness factor) = ((number of skips * average listen time prior to skip in seconds) + (number of full listens * 120 seconds)) total number of listens Lets say theres a song which you dont like much in an album.Youve listened to it 5 times and skipped it 4 times after 10 seconds on average.If you listen to song for complete duration it accounts as 120 seconds.Then it gives us ff = (4*10 + 120)5 = 32 seconds.For songs which havent been skipped theres no need to calculate the favoriteness factor.Then the songs can be sorted ascending by favoriteness factor to present the least liked songs first.		21 October 2012 - 06:00 PM	mr2dark

I normally copy the artist folder, and then, subfolders with the albums example : Nirvana #092; 1991 - Nevermind #092; 1993 - In Utero #092; 1994 - Unplugged in New York.

compressor	First off this is a great App. I purchased it and use it everyday. It has many great features including headphone detection and delete. One feature I would like to see is a compressor whereby one could set it so that soft songs and louder songs would sound about the same volume so as to keep from fiddling with the volume control. Thanks, John		01 January 2011 - 10:11 PM	jwdiana	[Thanks for the feedback. The replay gain support is planned, though, its not the compression, but its much better as it doesnt require pretty complicated configuration of compressor (which will never work well for some tracks). Also, automatic preamp limiter is also planned for equalizer, though, this is mostly to avoid bass overamplification and the distortion.];[As you say, replaygain is not compressor.Please do compressor. My classical tracks are too quiet to hear the quiet parts when Im driving the car, but the loud parts are quite loud enough.Compressor would solve this problem. The compressor could configure by sampling the microphone during quiet parts and between tracks to measure the ambient noise.Maybe the compressor wont work well for all tracks, but without it there is no reason for me to buy Poweramp. I aim to buy the first decent player that has this support, or the first audio-filter that provides it.];[I will revive this topic with another request for an compressor. Replaygain or other normalization schemes are NOT the same as a dynamics compressor. They will only adjust the loudness of the track. A dynamics compressor is able to alter the dynamics of a song, so quiet and loud parts will be at closer volume. This is a really, really useful feature for a portable audio player, Im currently immensely enjoying the feature in the rockbox audio player, and its one of the main reasons why I havent moved from my Sansa Clip+ to my Samsung phone for music playback. Please consider adding a dynamics compressor to Poweramp.];

counter?	hi, here to ask for a feature. could you implement some sort of counter that counts the total time Poweramp played? like in foobar. just total play time, and a reset button. id does not have to be in the main window, somewhere in settings. it would be nice when trying to determine battery life. also, a small thing i consider a bug. in the playlist, if you hold a finger on a song, the menu pops up (the one with enque, delete, etc...). in my opinion it pops up too easily. 3 out of 5 times i want to select a song i end up opening that menu. could you make so that you need to hold your finger on a song name a little bit longer before the menu pops up?

analog volume knob	I find I like using the analog volume knob in the tonevolume menu because the hardware buttons on my RAZR MAXX are stepped too far apart to adjust the volume precisely to my liking much of the time. However, I believe the analog volume knob in Poweramp could use some improving (at least on the RAZR MAXX) as its not consistent and reliable all the time and as precise as a true analog knob should be. Of course, this could be related only to Poweramp within the RAZR MAXX but if possible to address it that would be much appreciated. I also wouldnt mind an option to have the the analog volume knob able to be placed on the playing screen rather than drilling down into a menu to use it, although I understand this may be tricky for aesthetic reasons.

queue progression - repeat mode	This stems from this post: http:forum.poweram...een-yes-or-not Basically if you, like me, play your entire music library but like to select a particular set of songs to play now and again but then return to the normal quot;all playquot; list the current looping system is annoying. Because I want my entire music to loop through indefinatly I use the quot;Repeat Listquot; option, but as soon as you play a queue of songs that starts to loop the queue and never exits the queue if your using the specific queue exit option outlined in the linked post. The only way to exit the queue is to have it on any other repeat option, but then it wont loop the main list once its exited the queue. So I think something like another repeat mode like: Loop but advance queues. It probably sounds more complicated than it is, but if you read the linked post and replicate it its quite obvious.		02 October 2012 - 10:14 AM	DTWD	[Or not, it appears to be looping with one track now.

volume fade when sleep timer set	It would be nice to have the option to select in a tickbox below the minutes slider, in sleep timer menu, to make the volume fade as the time goes to expire... Since some of us use it during sleep and set the timer so that it closes and not wake up, it would be more natural and more quot;sleeping friendlyquot; the volume decreases in a rate (exponential, linear or whatever) (example 1). If you are still awake and feel the volume too low then by pressing the up-volume button you can bring it back to normal and may start the decrease again (example 2).

listening to podcasts	Im sure that most people use Poweramp to listen to music. However, I suspect there are many others like me who use it to listen to podcast files. Every week I download around 20 files of programs from the BBC and NPR, so that I can listen to these while out walking. I want to listen to them in the order that they were broadcast, so I prepend the broadcast date to the file name, and then upload them all to one folder for replay. While this is possible with Poweramp, it is by no means ideal. While I did find it possible (with difficulty) to get the folder to display and play the files in filename order, I have found no way to get the status to show the file name, rather than the tags, which in general I do not want to see. I wonder if it would be possible to provide a set of podcast-friendly settings to assist folk like me? Chris		05 July 2012 - 09:24 AM	ChrisJakarta	[+1. I just use an ISO-date format for the podcast track-titles for now (I tag the Artist and Albums too). Keeps them in order, and easier to find. A resume feature for any track with Speech as the genre, to start where one left off when playing the track again (if listening to normal music tracks in between) would be very useful too#33;];[Some other minor features would be particularly nice when listening to podcasts: 1. Skip back 10 seconds 2. Skip forward 30 seconds 3. Undo. It seems to be much too easy to accidentally skip to the next track (or to the beginning of the current track, etc), and then it can be difficult to get back to where you were. It would be nice to have an Undo feature that would take you to wherever you last were before the last jump. 4. Hide the album art. Most podcast mp3s seem to have no album art or uninteresting album art. It would be nice to be able to easily toggle hideshow the album art (perhaps by tapping the picture). (Really nice would be able to tell Poweramp to display random photos from my phones Pictures folder instead of the album art...) 5. Speed-up playback. Play the audio faster (in increments: 10, 20, 30 faster) and lower the pitch so it doesnt sound like chipmunks. (VLC does this, for example.)];[I (and a number of others) have been asking for a couple of years for features to help better navigate through longer audio tracks, but never really seem to get any firm promises of what is being done to support these sorts of issues. They effect people who listen to all kinds of music and audio - concerts, classical music, podcasts, audiobooks, radio shows, etc. Not all music comes in neat little 4 minute chunks. For example, Im listening to a 2.5 hour concert recording at the moment, and Im kinda scared of pressing anything in case I miss the button and accidentally skip to a different track and have to try to find my place again (which would be nigh on impossible). I hear people asking for spectrum analyser visualisations and goodness knows what, and find myself wishing that really basic navigation problems could be addressed before looking at bells, whistles and frills.

1: shuffle icon at the top of library lists. 2: move find outside of lists.	First off, thanks to the developers for what is hands down the best sounding mobile device audio player app#33; Heres what I love about it: The ten band equalizer is simply mind-blowing#33; The ability to save equalizer presets is awesome#33; I already have a preset for headphones and another for when the device is plugged into a stereo. Honestly, this is a feature that Ive been wanting in a player for a LONG time. I also love that it saves your place when you unplug from the jack and automatically resumes when you plug back into it. Heres what would make it (to me anyway) the best audio app on the planet. Ever: #1: Place a shuffle icon at the top of all library lists. Heres how a user has to shuffle all songs using the current library UI: go into library; go into All Songs; pick a song; click the suffle icon on the player interface; click the next button to make it actually randomly choose a song. Heres how it should work: go into library; click shuffle icon beside All Songs. OR: go into library: go into quot;All songs;quot; click shuffle icon (should be the first item in any list really). Your way: 5 clicks. My way: 1 or 2 clicks. Reducing those unnecessary clicks is a major reason why iTunes is so popular. Im not saying copy iTunes. I dont want you to get sued. Im saying if your competition has a smart, non-proprietary feature thank them for doing the market research for you and use it. Besides, having the shuffle being the first list item is a feature of all of your serious android competitors as well (doubleTwist has it, proplayer has it). Theres a reason for that. Its a nice little convenient feature that people use. #2: Move the quot;Findquot; feature outside of the list. Heres why. Say you start scrolling down the list of all songs, and say you have about a thousand on your device. About 7 scroll swipes later, you say to yourself, quot;You know what. Using Find would probably be faster.quot; Now you have to scroll all the way back to the top of the list. That shouldnt be necessary. You should be able to just tap quot;findquot; from any point in any list screen.		20 September 2012 - 03:53 PM	drhyatt	[Great ideas#33;];[Ditto];
a pack of ideias [updated with pictures#33;#33;]	My first post was a bit confusing so I decided to make it simple and give you some visual support for my ideas. Well, to make long story short, I recently switched to Android from an iPhone 3 GS and one of the main reasons was the fact that I found a good iPodiPhone player replacement: Poweramp. By now, Im already a huge Poweramp fan: its as visually simple as the iPhone music player (I actually like Poweramp better) but brings some serious power. However, there are some features I believe would make it even better. Heres my take: 1. Full Library Mode Library view works flawlessly and I believe many of you, like me, spend most of the time in this view. So it would be really nice to have customizable items (e.g. all songs, albums, artists, playlists, queue, etc) on the lower menu according to your personal preferences. This would also obliterate the need for the back button on the top right corner. Instead, the Filter button could be visible all the time which is handy because one wouldnt have to scroll all the way to the top#33; NOTE: the full library mode could probably be activated in the advanced settings. 2. Double tap on artwork for album songs Simple and fast. Lets see: 3. Improved Widgets Love widgets? Me too So how could the Poweramp widget be improved? Have a look: NOTE: Double tap artwork for the songs. 4. Smart Title If you listen to classical music as I do, it is very common to come across the frustrating task of navigating through album tracks: some are gigantic and identical. To make it easier, one could just swipe to scroll the text: NOTE: the blue boxes are indications only [hidden]#33; The idea is to swipe over the title to have it scrolled (Oh and I was lazy to copy the full library mode layout I suggested ) 5. Instant quot;Now Playingquot; If you like gestures like I do, then youd like quot;pinch to Now Playingquot;. Fast access from any location: Some of my other wishes: Cover flow in landscape mode#33; Itunes integration (syncing directly through Poweramp - Id pay for that ) On a final note, please keep in mind these are my quot;renderingsquot;. No copyright infringement intended So if youve made it through all the post and like my ideas, let me know (and please excuse my english)#33;		09 July 2012 - 09:11 AM	nuno	[Edited with renderings#33; Some of my previous ideas were already implemented (like current equalizer setting visible in portrait mode).];[Good points, and renderings... I like some of your ideas and will show this to Max thanks for being a fan#33;];[Thanks Wen#33; I would also like to let you know I can translate Poweramp to Portuguese (Portugal)];[especially request 4 (smart title) is very very useful#33; Some Folder and Song names are pretty long and currently it is impossible to see the whole folder name when browsing through folders... I tried everything, could not find any way to see the whole folder name. Moreover, the folder view does not respect subfolders... For example: Three albums are stored on sd card in quot;MusicSean Paulquot;... instead of keeping that order (i.e. showing the Sean Paul folder and only showing the three albums after one clicked at the sean paul folder), Poweramp separates every folder and shows each folder on its own. Pretty messy when having lots of subfolders#33; Please find a way to fix this or give us an option to do so...];[I Agree#33;];[Just use Hierarchical View mode, which shows the folder list top down.

different albums with same title	Currently, Poweramp merges albums with same title into one. This can be pretty annoying if you have, say, six albums titled Die Kunst der Fuge. It would be great if Poweramp could separate albums correctly, according to the performers. Of course, it also happens that different tracks in one album are by different artists. But it is easy to distinguish between these two cases by looking at the track numbers for different artists: they are consecutive, starting with 1, in the first case, and complementary in the second case.		22 September 2012 - 08:30 PM	twimouse	[The only solution we can give to you for this is to use the folder view instead. That way your music is setup the way you would like it to be, not the way we think it should be. Thanks for your support, and hope that solves your problem.];[Thanks for your reply. Actually, I did not like using the folder view, so I found a different workaround. I add invisible Unicode symbols to the title (using foobar - the ability is sort of built-in there). Simply adding spaces does not work as they just get removed. Still it is a pity that there is no tag-based solution.];
equalize settings by folder or album	I think it would be cool if you could save the EQ settings by folder or album. Some of my albums I like to listen with more bass, others not so much and Im usually shifting manually when necessary. The application could save automatically or an option to manually save to that folder album. Thank you.		25 September 2012 - 12:54 PM	Vehuel	
.pla playlist support	Are there any plans to add support for .PLA files? Poweramp doesnt seem to recognize them.		24 September 2012 - 09:53 PM	darrindyson

folder mod only	Hi, I would to know if its possible in a next release to add the possibility not to use the library feature #33; Actually, i mount the music stored on my nas directly on the phone. Then i add this folder in quot;music folderquot; in Poweramp.... The problem is that there are too many songs (hundreds go ) and Poweramp scan them to add them to the library #33;#33; So its unusable I dont use the library system, and use only folder listing feature....

exclude song or album from shuffle-all, remove song without delete from sd	Is it possible to implement a feature by which the user could designate an album or song to NOT be included in the shuffle-all mode? I have a few polkas, holiday music, instrumentals that I dont want to hear regularly and they keep popping up when shuffling all (I know, I can skip it, but that is inconvenient when driving or cutting grass). Also, in that same vein, it would be nice to be able to remove a song from the PA library WITHOUT deleting it from the SD card. Please share your thoughts.		29 August 2012 - 07:20 PM	skingolf	[then why using shuffle all ? using queue playlist and shuffle the song in the list can help u];[It is too time consuming to build a playlist containing all songs except the 10-20 albums (out of about 450) I want skipped (especially since youd have to add new music to the playlist every time you buy new music). Also, right now, on my phone PA cannot keep a playlist from going missing unless it is exported (another cumbersome step). This is a well-documented bug. I like to shuffle just about my entire library, except for the aforementioned 10-20 albums full of specialty music. Seems like a simple concept.];[Thanks for the feature request, well add it to the list.];[Cant you put all of those specialty songs in folders and then just uncheck those folders in the Music Folders section in settings?];[That is exactly what would help and if you want to play them latter on just check it in Poweramp settings=gt;Folders and Library =gt; Music Folders];[Im not suggesting there is no workaround, only that it is not optimal. Yes, that works, but it is cumbersome to have to do that. I end up playing them with stock player instead so I dont have to keep re-addingremoving specialty songs in a folder from PA library. But Id rather use PA all the time - much better soundfeatures.];[Quite, just need an option to define which songs should not be added to the all-songs shuffle list (e.g.concept or classical albums where the tracks flow into one and other, audiobookspodcastsradio shows, etc). A by-folder exclusion list would be the simplest, but also using genre tags (optional of course) could be another possible solution. Andre];[I just want to second this. I hate having all of these stupid ringtones mixed in with my music, but I do not want to delete them. I tried using the enqueue option, but as stated already, it takes FOREVER. I also dont like the exclude a specific folder work-around, that can almost be just as much if not more of a hassle especially if you just want to exclude a certain album for a while. There should be a place in the app called the quot;shelfquot;. You can long press an album or song and have the option of quot;putting it on the shelfquot;. It will put those files aside unless you go to the shelf to add them back into the library.];[RIngtones are easy to remove. As youll never want to listen to them in Poweramp anyway, just untick the specific folder that they are stored in (using Settingsgt;Folders and Librarygt;Music Folders), and theyll never be picked up during a scan and Poweramp will never play them at all. Andre];[- this is settled for 2.1, but for All songs, Im not sure if we can easily keep track of such excluded files. We can try though. Per-track context menu, though, can be gigantic this way. Thanks#33;];[Excellent, so when Im looking though my folders list, Ill just be able to select a context menu option of quot;Exclude folder from Shufflequot;. Sounds perfect, cant wait#33; Will it include any sub-folders too by the way?

selecting from search items results in playback mode changing	Not sure if this is a bug, an undocumented feature or a feature request. I always use Poweramp in Folders mode, but when I search for something and then select to play a title from the search results, Poweramp switches my playback mode to Songs. I think it should stay in the users chosen mode. Actually, when that happens and I get stuck in Song or Album mode, how DO I change back to Folders mode without causing the currently-playing song to be stopped?

anti headphone rumble feature	I think Neutron has a feature like this, but I was thinking that if you were to delete all frequencies below 20hz it would negate the rumble in most standard over-the-ear headphones when you crank the bass up real high, thus giving off a very clean deep bass, since our ears cant even hear frequencies at that level, it wouldnt degrade the sound quality		17 September 2012 - 03:28 PM	Mii123me

play just one song, then stop	If I tap on a song in a folder, Poweramp plays that song, then it continues on to play another song.

library now playing buttons in player ui	For new users to Poweramp, it might take them a while to figure out how to get back to the library or the list of songs that is currently playing. When I let other people borrow my phone to use the music player, they can never figure it out since it is so unintuitive. It requires that you either press the song name in the player UI, or press the menu button gt; folderlibrary. It would make the experience much better if there were two buttons on the top of the Player UI screen: one leading back to the main folderlibrary screen, and another leading back to the specific list of songs currently playing.		04 August 2012 - 05:02 PM	oneillperson	[There is a button on the top of the player that takes you back to the folder.

Apple owns rights to the functionality of changing songs back and forth using a headphones controls, so Android manufacturers cannot built their phones to have such a feature and so we cannot make Poweramp compatible. Sorry. I would love this feature as well, but it cant happen on Android.];[Not true. Both HTC and Samsung headset cables provide three-button controls for PlayPause, Forward and Back (although Samsung software uses them for PlayPause, Vol+ and Vol- by default, but thats easily changed though). Given that those two manufacturers make up the vast majority of Android phone sales now, Id suggest this is now the de facto standard for Android headset cables. The internal electrical design is a little different from Apples implementation though, which is why iPhone headsets dont work correctly for track control when used on Android devices. Andre];[Apple swapped two of the four contacts of the plug. You can notice that apple headsets sounds less loud on android phones unless you press the middle button, then they gets louder too. You can read dtails about the changed pin-layout here: http:forums.androi...-wont-work.htmlSimply use an adapter to change the layout back to android style. For example I use this one: http:www.amazon.dedpB006SECMM6 with my shure 3-button-apple-style-headset-cable on Galaxy SBut this adapter dont bring the outer headset-buttons to function, only the middle button is working and the normal sound level is back. I tried to use apps like quot;Headset Button Controllerquot; or quot;Headset Droidquot; and always found the outer buttons are still not working.

play mode in playlists	I think there needs to be an option to select a play mode for each playlist. For instance one playlist would be played shuffled while another playlist would play in sequence.

Some examples: * Listening to (especially classical) music on an airplane: here its desirable to absolutely crush the dynamic range - it may ruin the expression of the music, but its the only way to compete with the background noise. * In a car via bluetooth: peak limiting is desirable. * Audio book on handset speaker, (eg while getting dressed, moving around the room). The track should have fairly little dynamic range anyway; we want to boost it to as loud as possible (even accepting higher distortion than we would for music)];[Yes please#33;];[It would be hard to make this possible because some songs really arent meant to be as loud as others and Poweramp would end up making either everything quite or really loud, plus wrecking the quality of the song because its modifying the way it sounds... which might not really be a good thing. Thats just how I see it though.];[Of course youd have to be able to turn the feature on and off as the situation dictates. I have some classical music and instrumental soundtracks that may sound wrong, but normally skip those in a random shuffle anyway. When Im in the mood for instrumentals, I use a playlist. As a matter of fact, that reminds me about a feature request Ive made but never heard one-way-or-the-other about. Is is possible to implement a feature by which the user could designate an album or song to NOT be included in the shuffle-all mode. I have a few polkas, holiday music, instrumentals that I rarely want to hear and they keep popping up when shuffling all.];[I second that#33;#33;#33; Fabulous idea, would be a very useful feature#33;];
disable volume keys on lock screen option	I would love to have the option to disable the volume keys on the side of the phone while music is playing on the lock screen. I often walk with listening to music, with my phone in my pocket, and I tend to bump the hardware volume buttons when trying to put my phone into or pulling it out of my pocket.		29 August 2012 - 09:09 PM	realityinabox	
launch projectm from poweramp	Hi all, Im really happy with Poweramp on ics, just would be nice to have an optional button for those of us that have projectm intalled. This way it will give the feeling that Poweramp has a music visualizer, just like a thrird party plugin. Even more projectm already has Poweramp media controls.		29 August 2012 - 07:15 PM	Solaris_irc

display always on when charging	This should be a fairly simple one, and surprised it isnt there already (maybe it is, and I cant find it#33;#33;) Id like an option to keep the display on permanently when on charge - normally I have the display turn off after 30 seconds, and that means to change tracks whilst im driving means I have to take my hand from the wheel to switch the phone back on (i can change tracks without taking my hand off the wheel if the phone is on :-) ) Thanks DM		29 August 2012 - 02:19 PM	darthmuppet	[Use free application called Llama.

automatic song detection using google ears in jb	I understand how complex this would be, but it would be awesome if Poweramp allows to detect automatically a song using google ears service adding tags and album art to the song.

edit album-wide tags	What would be nice is, if Im looking at the albums themselves, long-pressing on the album will bring up a context menu where I could edit the genre of the entire album. Right now, it appears the only way to do this is to go into the album, and set the genre of each individual song in the album. If there is a way to do this in the current version (2.5.0-build 488), I would appreciate tips on how to do this. Otherwise, this would be a nice feature to have as Ive noticed that some of the albums Ive synched over to my phone have incorrect genres and I dont feel like selecting each track to switch it over.

album art?	When you long press on the art to choose an alternate, you are given choices, though I am unsure of the algorithm with which the program uses to provide these choices. It would be pretty awesome to be given an option to expand to a Google image search for the search string of the users choice or at least to default to the search string of the artist name. Then obviously to be able to assign an image of choice to the song or whatever. Sometimes, especially with singles or something, it is nice just to have a picture of the artist, as there is not always a corresponding quot;albumquot;, per se.		25 August 2012 - 01:41 AM	bionik9	[Dude.

album listing: add index number in front of track title	Hi, Using Poweramp 2.06.508 on Galaxy Nexus, Standard Goggle Rom JB 4.11 Question: is it possible to prefix each track title with the ordinal index position? For example, the 25th track in the album will be displayed as quot;25. My Cool TrackNamequot; Speaking of album listing, I would like to know if the following behavior is intentional. Currently the album listing display each track as a two lines info: Line1: Track Title - DurationLine2: Artist - Album Name When reviewing the content of the album, the name of the album is permanently displayed on the top of the screen. It is rather redundant to repeat the album name at every track. May be this layout is designed for other type of listing playlist where Album info is useful.

2 new requests	Hi there, Nice program lots of useful features, thanks for your work, filtering algorythmes are a bit weak but they kinda work okay. Look up for the korg algos they work a treat. Anyway my request is today about a possibility of getting a memorize function on the eqs and stuff, Im using Poweramp in my car over long distances and love that shuffle button. The main problem is I have to ride the eq all the time as most songs has a very differant sound and volume level. Can you make every tweek page with a save button that prompts you to apply to all songs in directory? Also a volume boost fader would be most welcome too as a lot of mp3s are poorly mastered therefore lots of headroom to play with. And even better, a compressorexpander that keeps thee volumes equal would be ideal. However a manual boost button that operates on the full range on top would be excellent. Another thing can you make Poweramp to autoduck the sound when another app sends a notification, or the navigation voice instead of just being mixed in, it would be so good.. There you go, hope this helps. Vz		06 August 2012 - 04:11 AM	vonzipstor

various artists in library-#62;artist	Hi, let me first explain, what problem there is to fix: my mobile music collection consists primarily of full albums but I have rather large folder with selected singles tracks. Naturally Poweramp doenst distinguish between the two and puts all of them in the Library. Each single track with its own entry in the artist and album lists#33; Say you 50 albums and 400 single songs, then both of the Lists will be cluttered with only 1- or 2-track artists you would never look for in this list. Me and I guess most of you would use the search function instead. Therefore the library view is pretty unusable for me#33; It would be nice to have a way to hide those singles in these lists. I see at least two possibilites. The quick and easy to implement one: I manually set the quot;album artistquot; of all my single tracks to quot;Various Artistsquot;. If the tag is present, Poweramp uses it in the artist list instead of the artist tag. The main play view shouldnt be affected by this, I still want to see the real artist there. Getting rid of the album tag (myself) is enough to fix the album list. A much more convenient and less dirty way: add some kind of quot;number of trackquot;-threshhold option in the preferences. Set it to 3 and only artists with more than 2 tracks will show up in the artist list. Thanks for an otherwise awesome software		26 July 2012 - 11:58 AM	bore	[I like your 2nd suggestion.];[I like the first option and I actually retagged all of my mp3s last night with the quot;album artistquot; as various. Even if the library list just had the option of view by quot;album artistquot;. I thought quot;albums by artistquot; which is already in Poweramp would do that but I was mistaken. EDIT: Ive went into Albums in my library and then sort by artist, thats good enough for me#33;];
enlarge backtoplayer button in libraryfolderseq views	Hi, At the bottom bottom of the Library, Folders, Equalizer and NoneVol screens there are 3 buttons: [player, library, folders] or [player, equalizer, tonevol].

back to player from library (or folders)	Im trying to latest version again. 2.0.6-build-508 Full version. Something I dont like, is when you are in the Player and press the song name artist name and it takes you to the Library, pressing the Android back button does NOT take you back to the Player. Instead it takes me back a step in the Library. Is there a setting that will fix this, or is this a feature request I shall put forth?		24 July 2012 - 10:48 PM	griff	[Sorry there isnt a setting for that, it was actually requested before by another user that it does that.];[Oh cool, good to know.];[Yes#33; Id really love this too#33;];
crosstalk option please#33;	I cannot find this option. Normally when listening to music on speakers a certain amount of crosstalk is introduced. This is natural. On headphones crosstalk creates a similar effect. It allows a certain amount of each channel to bleed into the other channel. This makes listenng on headphones less fatiguing and natural. How well this is executed though is another matter. A DSP plugin into the chain like HeadFit works on PCs. RockBox has it built in on certain MP3 player firmwares. Poweramp appears not to have this feature, which is unfortunate. Any chance of investigating adding it as an option? It makes so much of a difference in the listening experience. Better than any fake surround rubbish IMHO.		23 July 2012 - 09:25 PM	DeadMan	
buttons at ends of sliders (for more accurate settings)	Hi there#33; - I wanted to say (and I will say it again and again#33;), that this is a fantastic music player which easily beats the music player I have on my PC hands down#33;#33;#33; As a sound engineer and audiophile, this app has now become my benchmark for ALL other music players, whether on PC, MAC, smartphone or otherwise#33;#33;#33; My one and only request, a small one, is to include buttons placed at the ends of sliders (eq, settings, etc,.), so that settings can be made more accurately. I have a smaller screen device (ZTE Blade S San Francisco 2), and making accurate settings can be a little fiddly at times#33; Other than that, this is the greatest sounding, most fully-featured music player Ive ever had#33; Thank you so very much again#33;		17 July 2012 - 04:06 PM	bigbadbob	[I dont understand what you mean, can you be a bit more detailed in what youd like.

file rating tags	Ive got most of my media library nicely tagged and rated on my desktop. Syncing the songs to my phone would cause a transcode (mines mostly a Flac library) to ogg vorbis -q.5.

extend remote control support for volume control	Hi I love Poweramp, its great, its THE music player Ive been missing on android.

embedded cue for mp3	Hi there#33; I was just wondering (as it would be a killer feature for me, I have about 200 dj sets recorded in mp3 format) if there is any technical reason that lossless formats (flac, wv, etc) support embedded cuesheets in Poweramp, but mp3 doesnt? I can create a separate .cue file referencing an mp3 and this works, but it would be much easier to manage if I could embed them in an extended id3 tag (I use isyncr, so copying over cuesheets to match what mp3s are on the phone is a bit of a chore, and also means that my syncd playlists reference the non-cued mp3).

album cover flow	Hi, this is one fantastic app#33; Very nice looking, great features and the sound quality of the Audio Engine is superb. I would love an option to be able to swipe the covers in the player, not for changing songslists directly, but to view them back and forth before tapping to play. Often you dont know what next albumsong will be before tapping quot;nextquot; or swiping. With this feature you could look forward(or backward) and choose, without having to exit the player screen and browse the folderlibrary. Best regards, Jonas		30 November 2011 - 07:35 AM	bomberclaad	[+1 I would like to see this functionality when browsing the library. Especially on tablet, this would work well. Something like the way the built in google player works would be cool.];[+1];[Poweramp can already achieve this by first using the Stop button on a track. After stopping a track with the Stop button (press+hold the Playpause button), you can then swipe the album art in an Album Cover flow style without the next track always playing on each swipe.

selectable font size for titles, artists and albums	A terrific product as is but I do have one request. In a car when the phone is in a holder it is almost impossible to see text for the song title, album name and the artist name on the main play screen. In fact these are so small that they are pretty much useless at least when Im the driver (Im 56 and the eyes are not what they used to be - think of all of the baby boomers! :geek: ). So the request is for an option where the size of that text is selectable at the expense of the album art size - art definitively needs to stay there but can shrink accordingly. One idea that could work is to be able to do that by swiping over the text info on that screen updown or leftright while keeping the tap for switching to the list. Swiping motion is very convenient in the car. Im talking specifically about the main Play Screen but the FoldersLibrary Lists, the widgets and the Locked Screen could use a larger font option as well for the same reason. Thanks for the consideration :mrgreen:		26 January 2011 - 12:50 AM	mizius	[I agree almost exactly with the posters ideas. I too am in my 50s and drive for a living.

I personally would be willing to pay a few more dollars for each feature that I request that is implemented.];[Thanks for the request. This will be covered by using additional skin packs for PowerAMP v2.0. I will personally create couple of car skins and we can also expect something from the community (the skin dev. kit will be open).];[I still consider Poweramp to be a great player (love the folder capability) but ... I just drove for 10 hours and this remained me of the font size request. Once again, the existing UI setup is designed for interaction while holding the device relatively close to the eyes but is extremely difficult to (and dangerous!!!) navigate when the device is in a car dashboard holder and one is driving - cant see the text, cant see the buttons (like Shuffle). To make it even worse I have a roadster with hard suspension so car shakes just compound issues with the screen interaction (all kinds of shakin going on) - basically have difficulty hitting the right controls (like foldersong selection).BTW - I use an Android app called Car Mode when driving (http:googlemobile.... ... sonal.html) to address the issues with screen interaction. It automatically adjusts profile (ex: BT on, GPS on, WiFi off, etc) plus changes the GUI into a simple grid of very large icons so that it is easy to see and navigate Android panels. For mounts that signal the car mode Car Mode app acts automatically when putting the device inout of the holder so I dont even need to press anything to change the mode. Maybe that is something that Poweramp could integrate with?Thanks for listening and would be happy to sign up for beta testing.];[Finding it hard to see the text (track name adn track numer) when driving in the car.

multiple equaliser settings per song	Having the ability to have more than one equaliser setting: For instance, I have a number of presets - eg headphones, car etc Some tracks, however can have problems - need more bass etc. I can make a preset for that particular track but it it is going to be based on one of my existing presets (eg headphones + a bit more bass). This is fine if I am listening on my headphones, but not so good if the song comes on while Im driving. For these situations, it would be good to have a preset which adds to the current preset, what ever that preset is. So if Im using the car preset and this track comes on I get car + special track preset, or if Im using my headphones I get headset + special track preset		09 July 2012 - 07:07 AM	BillBrowne

turn onoff bluetooth and audio connection	Hello#33; It would be great if we could force BT on amp; audio conection, right from Poweramp, as the HTC stock music player can do on Desire HD (Sense 3.5?): From the player, and with BTwifi off, you choose the BTwifi device from a list, and the player turns on BTwifi, connects to the selected device, and starts streaming audio to it. (it automates the task of turning BTwifi on, connecting to device, and then starting Poweramp and play music) And finally, an optioncheck to turn off Bluetooth on Poweramp exit (and save battery when you finish streaming to BT device) What do you think?		08 July 2012 - 04:37 PM	Tomajauk

full screen album art	Poweramp is almost perfect what i find missing is a shake to next song (optional on-off) and a full screen album art option I realy like the big album art on TTpod but i use Poweramp cause of the sound settings is there a way to make a almost-full screen album art but without too much scaling as on TTpod This could be optional (for us that has bigger mobiles like galaxy note i would like smaler buttons and bigger album art ) so you swipe 2 fingers or click on album art to get it full screen but important then when is full screen that you can change song swiping album art in full album art mode like when you do in the now normal mode. this could be optional atleast		26 December 2011 - 11:21 AM	Angelos	[Hi all, I heavily second this request. I have a Samsung Galaxy S2 and I like to listen to music on my way to work which takes 45 minutes - 1 hour each way. As my phone is connected to a power source I like it keep Poweramp running in the foreground and the brightness set at 100 (especially when its sunny outside). After a couple of weeks, I noticed that the Play, Foward, Back buttons were burnt into the screen. And its not a temporary burn-I noticed it about a week ago and its still there. Right now, I am trying to fix it by running a couple of screen burn apps, crossing my fingers. I think having a full screen album art not only makes it cool-looking but also helps in reducing the chances of screen burn-in. The question that remains is the aspect ratio of the screen vs the album art. It would nice to keep the album art size proportional and the rest is just a gradient of color based on the colors in the album art (kinda like what Poweramp has right now for the frame).

What about a setting located at look and feel gt; player ui, a setting called quot;advanced uiquot; This button will make Poweramp more advanced with all features, and when its disabled,only necessary buttons show? I think thats a good idea and a good solution for those who complain about complexity.		28 June 2012 - 12:54 AM	Enitoni	[Good idea. Id like to have move space given to playback controls (larger seek bar, and extra nagivation controls such as jump fwdjump back) but wouldnt want the current buttons to be any smaller either... so reducing the size of the album-art area would seem to be the obvious choice, but that might not be everyones choice of course.

volume boost	I tried to listen some audios that doesnt have a regular volume. I maximize the parameters into the equalizer, but the volume doenst grow as i need.

shuffle on: all songs; shuffle off: current list	It seems since the recent update, this functionality has been lost. What I mean is that if I was listening to all songs on shuffle, and I all of the sudden wanted to listen to the next songs in the list, I used to be able to just turn shuffle off to achieve this. Now I have to go to the current list (not that hard) and then restart the song from the list with shuffle off. Ive also noticed that when I am listening to a list, having shuffle on would only shuffle within the list, where as in the previous version turning shuffle on from a list would return to shuffling all songs. Im not sure if this was actually a feature or just how it was programmed, but Id like a setting to make this a feature. I would be glad to elaborate for the developers if needed.		26 June 2012 - 03:14 PM	holdenr3	[Also, having quot;shuffle listsquot; on doesnt seem to do anything now. I swipe up or down on the album art, and nothing. Time to downgrade and hold back on my recommendations, I guess.];[Ok, so this is probably a bug, but Im putting it here.

poweramp should use the android #34;force stop#34; as an exit option	Hi, Max has explained many times on this forum and elsewhere that when a user presses Back button to exit the player application, that PA will automatically unload its running processes from Android after some brief time. However, with the recent 2.06 beta I have found this quot;automaticquot; unloading not to be the case, as the notification bar still displayed my last played item even hours after I had stopped using Poweramp and went to sleep. I tried to Kill Poweramp in the Advanced Task Killer android app but this did work, so in Advanced Task Killer I managed to do a quot;Force Stopquot; of Poweramp and this better put my mind at rest with no more notification bar display of Poweramp icon or anything. So I think that Poweramp should get a quot;Force Stopquot; action as a confirmation choice option when pressing Back button to exit Poweramp.... In fact when I exit some Android apps with back button, such as Es File Explorer, I am kindly shown a confirmation message letting me know that pressing back once more time will exit the app and this is what is needed for Poweramp users too. Please consider		24 June 2012 - 12:50 AM	haddy	[Poweramp doesnt clear out the notification when it closes, so thats why it remains.];

persistent notifications	I would love to have the ability to have a persistent notification in my tray.In ICS as it is right now it closes on pause (other music apps offer an X button. so they persist when you pause music) but I would like the option to keep it there all the time or conditionally (example: headphones plugged in, notification opens).		26 June 2012 - 02:13 AM	Wraeuk	[What version are you using? The newest one has the X button and doesnt close on pause.];[Ive just noticed this in the new version; thanks#33; I would still like for an option to keep it there all the time so I have access to it from the moment my phone boots; but this is a major improvement for me. EDIT: So Ive realised why I didnt notice this before... If you pause your music through unplugging your headphones this will kill the notification. Ive also notice it happen with short audio focus changes (notification will disappear and reappear). Not entirely sure if this is how stock ICS handles this but I would prefer if it would just pause my music and leave the notification there. Another EDIT: So it turns out the notification dies when youre pausing from anywhere NOT on the notification (audio focus change, lock screen, main app etc). This isnt the correct functionality; Google Music and various other apps that implement these notifications keep the notification when paused outside the notification specifically. I guess this belongs in the Bug Reports section of the site but Id rather not clog up the forum with repeat threads.];
eq presets selected automatically for different outputs	Essentially a tweak that would allow the app to automatically switch the EQ preset, dependent on the output.

landscape layout	I would like to request a new layout in landscape that makes the album art more prominent. The current implementation does not make efficient use of the screen real estate. Something more like playerpro might be better, with the album art taking up one entire half of the screen with the track information on the other (information scrolling if its too long naturally). I think alot of people use this in a dock in the car and better display of the album art would be nice. If this cant be done, making the player controls toggable by tap like the other controls, and resizing the album art accordingly couild also be a way to go. Thank you in advance.		22 June 2012 - 04:53 PM	wedge11	
landscape layout	I use my phone in Landscape quite a bit. The new UI has further decreased the amount of scrollable space when in landscape mode: It would be nice to have an option to make the header smaller in landscape or even turn it off.It would also be nice to have an option to enabledisable the information shown for each filefolder (Title, Artist, Progress Bar, # of Songs, Directory).

change scrollbar category scroll	Not sure if this is an Android API or something done by Poweramp, but when dragging the scrollbar, I would prefer if it organized it to be # in general, then the alphabet, rather than each number individually getting its own category.

tts on trackalbum change	I have 4000+ tracks and add to themchange them frequently.

true voice search a la car tunes	So far, voice search appears to search in the collection. This is no good when you are driving. There should be a gesture or button I can press from the player interface, that pauses the music, and listens to what I want to play, much like Car Tunes has. Also there should be an option to significantly increase font size in the collection browser, and control size everywhere.

Then have the songartist info in a bigger font on the other side or even overlapping the art if needed. Id personally just eliminate the payback buttons as I use the swipe gestures to skip trackslists (or stick them on each side, centered vertically), and just tap anywhere central onscreen to pauseplay.

folder structure with sub folders	Real folder structureWhen using the folder view, all folders are shown, with all subfolders. I use a lot of albums with two cds. Each cd in one subfolder. For example: mainfolder: "album", subfolder: "cd1" and "cd2". At the moment, in folder view, both subfolders are shown, named with their subfolder name "cd1" and "cd2". This is irritating.

user interface improvements	Hi, I started using Poweramp a few days ago and I really liked it. Although I have some comments about the UI. I dont know if its just me but I like things clear and simple. I dont think equ or tone-vol buttons on the top of the player screen are necessary. I mean we dont use them a lot and we can see the same settings just by using the menu button. Its not nice to see a bunch of buttons around. One more thing that I think that is unnecessary is the song quality info at the bottom of the player screen. You dont need to show every single thing on the screen, exspecially the things we dont need much. Also there can be a button such as quot;+quot; in the playlists part. It seems to be really hard to add new lists. One last thing... When we are in the library section and we touch artists for example, the sliding effect is to slow. Nice but slow. If the UI effects can be faster the app will be much more usefull. It would be really great if you guys can make UI improvements like these... Thank you for a great app.		10 June 2012 - 06:32 PM	cemp	[The funny thing about what youre saying is that everything that is on the main screen has been requested on multiple times and when we take them off we get hammered.

change behaviour of lt;lt; and gt;gt; buttons	Thanks a lot for this amazing player! I really love it! My special feature request is the following: Because I listen a lot to quite long talks and lectures ( 1h long), it is very unpleasant if a accidently hit the or button either on the screen or on my BT-headset and the player skips to the next MP3, because I then have difficulites manouvring back to the place I was in my lecture. So what I really would appreciate if I could disable the buttons or even better give them another function: not skip to the previous next song but skip i.e. 30 seconds backward forward within the running song. I would love you even more if you could implement this!! Stefan		06 July 2011 - 01:07 PM	StefanS	[Thanks for the feedback. You can change behavior of these buttons to desired one via PowerAMP Settings = Look and feel tweaks = resets current track (check).];[Doesnt that still lose the current playback positon though? I have the same problem with long tracks, in that if you accidentally move to a new track by mis-timing a press on the or button (or even just go back to the start of the current track) its the devils own job trying to get back to (for example) 43 25" into a track. I have asked a number of times whether it would be possible to make the trackpads rightleft swipe functions do a simple skip-forward-30-seconds or skip-back-15-seconds. That should be very easy to add as an option, and it would make navigation so much easier for me. Max, any chance this fairly simple feature could be added please?

If it is too diffucult to CHANGE the behaviour of the , , and buttons (both at the screen AND at the BT-remote control!) it would help me if they could be deactivated. It happens some times that I accidentially hit one of theses buttons and my position within the lecture is los. And as Andre statet quite well it is really a devils job to find the last position. But perhaps it is possible to make them changeable to skip 15 and skip 30.

select from multiple embedded album art images	It is possible to embed multiple images via tags but when I long press to change album art I only see one of the available embedded images.

sending files through bluetooth...	I think that it would be really handy if in Poweramp you had the ability to send files through bluetooth, like in the default media player (X10 Mini Pro), this could be done by adding it to the little menu that appears under a song when you long press on it. It would be really appreciated if you take this into consideration. Cheers		07 March 2011 - 08:53 PM	TheSlimRizla	[Thanks for the request.];[On Android it goes by the nameprotocol of "Share by" From that you can send to a file via Bluetooth to another Bluetooth device. Also other send to options such as Gmail, Messaging etc. I actually thought this already existed in Poweramp at least for the Folder lists and Library but I was mistakenly surprised when I didnt find it. PlayerPro and other music players have it. I hope this feature will arrive soon, hopeful for or just after v2.0 release. and actually called a "Send to" or "Share" feature in name.];[Im also hardly missing this. Listening to music and sharing the current is not possible with Poweramp, I have to switch to another application and search that song to share it via Bluetoothetc...

two feature requests please read	Hi, I Love Poweramp and have been using it for like a year and a half now, theirs two features Id like to see standard in Poweramp. First I would like a 5-band EQ with a second bass boost knob and virtualizer knob overlay over the 10-band EQ, for example the 5-band EQ would think your already tuned music from the 10-band EQ is standard thus increasing the bass and quality even more. Like combining Music Volume EQ app and Poweramp together, but make it a standard option in Poweramp. Second would be the ability to change the volume level by increments of 1, the Fine Volume app already does this, but Id like this standard in Poweramp, since for some strange reason the app pauses the music when you change the volume with it while using Poweramp.		30 May 2012 - 07:23 PM	Mii123me	
3 new features i#39;d like to request	First of all this is really the best music player for android. I really like it. It really worths the money to buy it. But I miss 3 features, it would be good to have them: 1 - multiple selection option for playlists to add multiple songs or to delete multiple songs. (not just one song or an entire folder#33;) Now if I want to delete some songs from a playlist, I need to delete them one by one. Its very slow this way#33; 2 - An quot;exitquot;, quot;homequot; or quot;minimizequot; button would be nice for the player. Since the software doesnt have any buttons like this, I always need to push the quot;homequot; hardware button on my device to go back to the main screen of my tablet. Its also working this way, but I dont like to push the hardware buttons so many times on my device, its a really expensive tablet which I have and Im afraid theyll wear out sooner or later if I always use the hardware buttons. 3 - A quot;seek barquot; would be nice for the widget. The player has a seek bar which is good, but the widget doesnt have. So if I want to have a quick listen into the middle of a song I always need to start the full player to do that. It would be good to do that with the widget on the desktop of my tablet. I wouldnt have to always open the full player in that case. Thanks in advance#33;		27 May 2012 - 08:07 PM	gabesz	
more individualized sorting options	Hi, the list options that are in Poweramp are good, but what would make them better is to allow sorting of individual folders the way you want them. Most of my folders are proper albums, but I do have a few that are just compilations of songs. The album folders Im fine with being sorted by track#, but I like to sort the compilation folders by title. As it currently stands, youre locked into using one sort method for all folders. My request for this is, along with that default sort order, to add independent list options controls to individual folders. That could be added to the list of options you currently get when you long press on a folder.		05 January 2012 - 04:54 AM	wolf359	[Wow, seriously? Anybody?];
status (notification) bar controls	I had this with my standard LG music player.. but my standard LG music player is garbage, basically when you pull down the notification bar it tells you the song youre listening to and has a little album art, and then playpause back a track and forward a track.. itd be a lot more convenient than having to open the app up every time, especially if youre doing something already. I only have the trial version right now but Im guessing its exactly the same as the full (I am buying the full imminently though)		23 May 2012 - 11:00 PM	OptimusCrack	[Yeah that feature is present in Poweramp already, but only in Android 4.0 version.

sort by file extension first	Hi, Itd be great if Poweramp would sort its track list by file extension first, so that you could have mp3 and flac versions of the same album together in the same directory. Thanks#33;		15 May 2012 - 05:54 AM	fugounashi	
i#39;m not sure if this has been requested but...	Support for Album by ArtistYear would be very nice. I have my playlists sorted as such in iTunes and when I sync my Bionic it messes up the order, and when I re-sort to just Album by Artist the numbered artists are before the lettered ones and the quot;The...quot; artists are sorted with the quot;Tquot;s.		15 May 2012 - 03:05 AM	MisSigsFan	
laying items in the playlist	I like this application, but only this feature was missing to be completely happy. At this moment the playlist can be only sorted.

respect #34;automatically lock#34; security timeout	In ICS there is an option to Automatically Lock either Immediately or after xx seconds. If I enable the Poweramp lock screen (not ICS lockscreen) which I like better because it has many more music controls, it enables immediately instead of waiting the xx seconds set in this option. My feature request would be for Poweramp to wait the specified number of seconds before displaying the lockscreen just like the built in ICS lockscreen does.		09 May 2012 - 08:25 PM	alferz	
delete button on a lock screen widget	Poweramp has wonderful feature - it allows to delete file from SD card with Delete button. However, to delete a file I have to: 1. Unlock screen 2. Open Poweramp player 3. Call application menu 4. Push Delete button I guess, it could be much more convenient if you add some kind of menu to locking screen widget which is opened by a long tap so that this menu contain Delete item. Than it would be easier to delete current song: 1. Long tap on a lock screen widget 2. Select Delete menu item.		04 February 2011 - 02:24 PM	wax	[This is the one feature that is keeping this player from beating another player for me.

Until now I did the version with one star, but deleting it immediately is much better#33; What about a menu, (on lockscreen and app), which you can personalize.

For example, deleting the current song, putting it into a special playlist or what ever. thanks and bye e.];[The star rating idea kind of works. The stars are a little small to be trying to hit without looking though. i am driving a 100 foot long semi, the last thing i want to do is kill a bus full of kids while trying to get rid of an annoying song, lol. i have just accepted that i will have to listen to some bad songs a few times before i am in a position to label them for deletion, and have to use both the 1 and 2 star ratings for deletion so i can miss a bit and still succeed. there is a nice empty bar on the tp of the screen that could hold a button or 2 though.];

two things that i need……					
need a resume feature	Need a resume feature or bookmark for listening to podcasts. The location seems to disappear after time when you come back to continue listening.		11 November 2010 - 09:55 PM	pcaple	[This feature is the only one left for a music player which covers all my needs! Still, its very very important to me... cant really use the player atm... at least not for podcasts audiobooks.

At least add it on the to-do-list...];[Resume?];[You can pause and resume a song];[Hm, no we mean that the player saves the exact sport of the track you stopped playing. (e.g. 1:14:92) and resumes there, or maybe 5 seconds before when you play it again (after you played something comething completely else). This would be resume. Bookmarks are a list of those shortcuts. They are created manually, have names and are available via a menu.];[Let me just bump this (I sorely lack a playlist resume feature, and am now actively looking for alternatives to PA because of this.

A resume-long-tracks or a resume-if-from-a-specific-folder should be easy enough to implement internally within Poweramp (so no external technical Android issues why not) and obviously an awful lot of people want this as an option for all sorts of different track types - podcasts, radio shows, audiobooks, classical music, etc. Thanks, Andre];[I also think is a necessary feature. Almost the only missing feature. Please Maxim, add this feature. Thanks much.];
remember current track and time for each album	Hi#33; I listen often to audiobooks and sometimes I want to switch to a musicfolderalbum. When I switch back to the audiobook the player starts with the first track. So for me Its neccesary that the player remembers the track and time for each albumfolder and continues when selecting a album at this mark. Thanks, Sven		19 December 2011 - 11:58 AM	Svenaldo	[+1 I agree with Svenaldo. My Sansa Clip+ has this feature. It knows which files are Audiobooks and keeps the progress while I listen to other Songs. Maybe one could use the tags to differentiate betweet music and Audiobooks and just remember the last file and time of the last song with the Audiobook tag? Too much of a workaround? ^^];[There could be a simple .dotfile, which if found in a folder would indicate that the folder contains audiobooks, podcasts, etc. The files within that folder would then allow saved playback positions - possibly via simple filenameposition entries in that same .dotfile, or another .dotfile matching each filename? - and they could also be excluded from any random-order playback modes, which was another request for audiobookpodcast files.

I still havent found a good audiobookpodcast player that will remember track timeposition once I stop playback or switch to another song];
persistent playlist positions	(The longer I think about this and google around, the more I get the impression that what I want must be pretty esoteric. If there is another way to achieve what I want that I somehow missed, Im all ears#33; Anyway, might as well get it out of my system:) So I find myself listening to music in a number of contexts. One context is quot;regularquot; (in the car or walking somewhere), another one is quot;backgroundquot; (need pleasant unobtrusive music to mask out the work noise), yet another one is quot;runningquot; (need uniformly upbeat music). quot;Backgroundquot; and quot;runningquot; are playlists, quot;regularquot; is just the queue (since Poweramp seems to lack the concept of an automatic quot;Now Playingquot; playlist). What irks me about this arrangement in Poweramp, though, is that whenever I quot;switch contextquot;, the playlistqueue I switch to starts playing from the beginning. Id much prefer it if it would start where I left it when context-switching away. Do I perhaps miss some existing magic configuration knob? Or is this impossible by design? Any alternatives? Thanks#33;		23 April 2012 - 04:15 PM	cmmike	
automatically rating of played songs	Very useful and interesting feature - rate the playable tracks according to the time of play and number of repetitions of play. Rating is not assigned if less than 10 percent of the duration of the song heard. The song rating higher, which is fully listened to more times than one that does not fully listened to, and fewer times. I listen to songs from the phone in the car, an airplane, anywhere - would be useful to all this feature#33; Better to save rating of each song in the service area of ??the mp3 file. Rating that is displayed to the user will be seen as 5 stars, each star can be a half. It is better to keep ratings in coded form, which includes information of the number of repetitions and the total time listening. This information can be used to transfer files to your computer for cross-platform, now Im writing a plugin for the player Aimp.		08 April 2012 - 05:19 PM	sorockinalex	
playpause button in the notification	One feature I really miss from other players is a Pause button directly inside the notification bar		09 December 2011 - 08:05 PM	ninjaw	[Thanks for the request. This is planned feature for PowerAMP on Androids 3.04.0 As for Androids 2.x, OS always closes the notification panel when something is pressed in it (this is forced by the Android 2.x), thus placing control buttons like lt;lt; gt;gt; is not appropriate there. Still, pause play may work there.];[Nice. This will be a great addition. Until it is ready in PowerMP you can get this functionality by using the app called Wigetsoid to place a play and pause control in your notification area all the time.];[Cant we just make double tapping the album art a pause button? (atleast as an option)];[This would be really nice. The notification controls are the one thing I miss from Google music on Ice Cream Sandwich. It is so much easier to just pull down the notification bar and pause skip than having to go into the app and mess up what you are currently doing. Please hurry with this update, it would be extremely nice#33;];[hi maxmp. out of curiousity, how did Samsung manage to get this done in their galaxy s 2 phones? is it safe to assume that this is tied to the touchwiz overlay? it really caught me by surprise when their music app showed up in the notification pulldown with playback controls without closing it per keypress.];[Hi I see this has been implemented, so thanks for that. However, in its current state (in ICS) the notification panel closes the app when paused. For Googles quot;Play Musicquot; player the notification stays open until you close it with an X button. I dont know if this has been asked before but I would find it really useful if Poweramps notification behaved the same way. This way that pause button would actually work as a pause button instead of as an exit button.];
long audio file handling (radio shows, podcasts, spoken word, etc)	Hi Max, I know youve said before that Poweramp isnt really an audiobook player, which is fair enough, but many users are also using Poweramp to play podcasts and radio shows which have much the same sort of navigation issues. There are two really simple little features which would go a long way to alleviating the problems that Poweramp currently has with either of those two audio formats: 1) Add an option to exclude very long audio files from shuffledrandom playback lists. I would suggest making the length user-definable, but if you just want to make it a simple onoff tickbox then Id suggest about 10 minutes would be an appropriate value. 2) Add an option to store the current playback position for any long audio files, so that when something else has been played in the meantime, going back to the original track will automatically re-commence at the last-played position. Again, a user-definable value would be nice, but 10 minutes or so should be fine by default. These two very simple options would be a massive improvement on usability versus the current way that podcasts and other spoken-word files are handled, but without impacting in any way on music playback performance. I would be grateful if you could consider these two additions as at least a small nod toward the many people who have asked for variants of these features in the past, and thank you for all the hard work you put into this application. Andre		03 April 2012 - 09:54 AM	andrewilley	[Hello, I dont think this will work well. Chapter lengths tend to vary a lot from book to book, setting one good-for-all lenth will prove impossible. I have two more suggestions completing those of Andre: 3) Add an option to display buttons for forwardbackward skipping a set number of seconds. The length could be user-configurable, but its not essential. 5 or 10 secs will work, I think. 4) Add an option to increasedecrease play speed i.e. by increments of 50. When you listen to speech, this is a must. Thank you for considering these humble suggestions. Your application is simply astonishing. Akos];[That would work very well too, and would also be pretty easy to implement (maybe something as simple as a quot;.spokenwordquot; file in any folder you wanted to be treated as containing podcastradioshowaudiobook files). Its important that any such feature should not be for audiobooks specifically though, as Max has already said he does not intend to make Poweramp an audiobook-friendly player. It needs to be broadly for any spoken word files, of which there are many different types. I do like the jump forwardbackward option too - Ive been asking for that feature for ages though, as its far more useful than the hold-for-fastforward (or backward) facility when listening to any type of audio (music, radio, whatever). I suggested 30 secs forward and 10 secs backward (for quick recaps) I think. Andre];

startup ui request	Poweramp is the best music player for android till date. 1. Please add an option to display the albums directly on the player startup. 2. An other request is to make the album arts a bit smaller so that more albums can be displayed on a single page on grid view. 3. Please do include a small scrollbar for the grid view of the albums for easy scrolling. 4. Caching the album arts so that they load the album art faster.		01 April 2012 - 05:49 AM	gowthaman400	
individual genre equalisers	Hi, Sorry if this has been bought up before. I have many different genres in my library and finding equaliser settings that work across each of them is difficult. Itd be perfect if you could quot;assignquot; different equaliser setting to specific genres. i.e preset 1 to rock, preset 2 to folk, preset 3 to RnB. I know that you can assign presets to things like specific songs but genres would be ideal. Cheers PS. Keep up the good work. Loving Poweramp#33;		24 March 2012 - 10:03 PM	Bliss79

automatically detect the character set for non-unicode id3 tag, then display the music information properly.	I know that in Poweramp, users can select the character encoding settings and then rescan for music files. However, some users may have music files which non-Unicode ID3 tag encoding are different with other music files that use non-Unicode ID3 tag. For example, I may have Chinese songs and Japanese songs, and all music files ID3 tag were non-Unicode. Assuming that some of my Chinese songs ID3 tag use Simplified Chinese (GB2312 or GBK encoding) character set, Other Chinese songs ID3 tag use Traditional Chinese (BIG5) character set, and all Japanese songs use Japanese character set. If, in Poweramp setting, I set the encoding tag to Simplified Chinese and then rescan the music files, Poweramp may properly display the ID3 tag information for Chinese music files that use ID3 tag encoded in Simplified Chinese, but Poweramps music library may still display garbled text for Chinese songs that use Traditional Chinese (BiG5) encoded ID3 tag and the Japanese songs. While letting users select the encoding for non-Unicode ID3 tag, please also include an option that make Poweramp automatically detect the character encoding of the ID3 tags, then do any of the following: 1. convert the non-Unicode music ID3 tag into Unicode format, then store the information in the music library, but let the users preview the result before store in music library. Or, 2. Store the character set information of ID3 tag of each music file into music library, and make the music library use the stored character set information of each songs to display the information about the songs. Or, 3. beside above, developers can just use any ways to make Poweramp music library properly display the information for each non-Unicode ID3 tags that use different character set. For your information, even though I use Android phones and never use Iphone and Ipad, according to my online research, for all musics, the music application (Ipod) in Iphone and Ipad can properly display the music information regardless of the ID3 tags stored in which character set. If this is true, I hope Poweramp can do the same. Thank you#33;		23 March 2012 - 03:35 AM	TMnutSucks

streaming radio api	I have searched the threads and found some of your basic responses to streaming radio (Pandora, Grooveshark, Slacker, etc...) integration. Since most of these services already provide desktop clients, some even provide mobile clients, they must already provide APIs for their streaming web services. Do you know if any of those providers are willing to work with you on allowing Poweramp to connect via their API to their services? I would imagine that in order to be financially viable those services would only allow access through a 3rd party app (such as PA) for paid subscribers. From the PA side of the equation has there been any research or plans for such integration? I would think that Grooveshark would be a great partnership with PA, and I know that it would bring more paid users to both parties.		09 March 2011 - 04:05 PM	JayHen	[There is planned support for audiogalaxy streaming via plugin for PowerAMP.

random album play	One of the favorite things about my Creative Zen player was the quot;Album of the Dayquot; feature. With one click of a button, it would choose a random album on your player and play the songs in order from start to finish. I have over 500 albums on my phone, and I would love the option for Poweramp to randomly choose one to play. I think this request was already made in another post (topic #1867), but Im not sure that the response from the moderator actually pertains to this feature. Or, if it does, I havent been able to figure out how to get Shuffle to accomplish this. If this feature Im requesting is indeed already built in, could someone please walk me through the steps to get it to work? EDIT: As it turns out, the quot;Shuffle Lists, Songs in Orderquot; feature replicates this, but its functionality was a little confusing to me at first. In order to change albums (if you dont like the one that was randomly selected), you can click on the gt;gt;gt; button on the far right to switch to another random album. Thanks Poweramp#33; Second EDIT: Ive figured out why I couldnt get this to work before. You have to choose to play an album through the quot;Albumsquot; part of the library for this feature to work. If you instead enter your music library through quot;Artistsquot; and are playing an album, then the gt;gt;gt; button (even when quot;Shuffle Lists, Songs in Orderquot; is selected) proceeds in order to the next album of the artist (or the next artist in alphabetical order if its the last album of the currently playing artist). Hope this clears things up for someone who was similarly frustrated at first.		11 March 2012 - 10:29 PM	lifter

three new feature requests	Before I start poking holes, I have to say that Poweramp is so far ahead of every other music player for Android that there is basically no competition. That said, here are a few of the things I would like to see implemented or improved: I would like to see an artist-specific implementation of the Album Title tag in cases where two or more artists have albums with the same title. For example, if I go to Greatest Hits in my Album list right now, it says there are 50 tracks on that album, and that its by Journey. In reality, I have three different Greatest Hits compilations in my library. If I play that Greatest Hits album, the first song I get is a Foo Fighters tune, then a Bruce Springsteen tune, THEN Journey. It seems to be parsing the list first by track number, then alphabetically by track title. It would be great if the album list said: Greatest Hits (Bruce Springsteen) Greatest Hits (Foo Fighters) Greatest Hits (Journey) And then allowed me to play whichever one I want. This, along with the implementation of the Album Artist tag mentioned in another thread, are the two biggest holes I see in the app. Next, I would love to be able to control volume via the main player screen. Maybe allow me to set either the list controls or Volume via the updown swipe? And finally, I find that the Direct Volume Control setting works really well in my headphones, but not so well in my car. A more convenient way to get to that setting would be appreciated.		05 March 2012 - 09:11 PM	hovershark

poweramp #38; possibilities of google music (hypothetical question)	Was going to go on a rant on why you guys dont support steaming from Google Music since surely they have an API Then after a quick Google search it seems... there is no API support :| Thus this request is moreso on the burden of Google for not doing API support that would allow for easier access to their service which is great but, their music app seriously seriously sucks balls for Android... which I can kinda blame you guys for spoiling me But this leads to my main question, ifwhen Google decides to do API for Google Music, you guys think itd be possible to fit that in PowerMP as far as the GMusic library accessible for playback?		31 December 2011 - 08:43 AM	mytouchnotyours	[I had just emailed re: the same; your research was better than mine. This is an unfortunate thing since over half my collection now is online only at Gmusic. Increasingly, it makes P-amp obsolete. There is no point switching back and forth between apps wondering where things are. Thats highly regrettable as Id much rather use P-amp. Im surprised G-music doesnt support access. Usually they are pretty good about such things. Right now, Im using Google Tasks Organizer which simply acts as a 3rd party interace to Google tasks. People have calendar apps using G-calendar and sync to it; and voice activation apps that use google voice recognition on android. It wouldnt seem like such a big deal. But the inability to be allowed to support streaming greatly interferes with the usefulness of P-amp now. The truth is that g-music provides amazing storage capabilities. Its hard to ignore. I greatly prefer P-amp as a player, but I cant give up over half my collection to use it.];[Yea monsieurms I can definitely understand where you coming from on that using Google Music half the time myself. My huge hangup is the fact that Googles own music player doesnt seem as easily integrated within Android as Poweramps own solution. A very huge hangup with Google Music not even talking to my bluetooth remote (a HUGE inconvenience for when I drive) nor any lockscreen flexibility. The quality of Poweramp is great at making their music player great enough where listening to music is more of a convenient experience that have me wish I had a 64GB memory card. Whereas Google Music is more of a quot;hey, your music is here... what more do you want?quot;. The dilemma Im caught in with the two is the quality of PAmp as a player vs the quantity of music available from Google Music (and to a lesser extent, Spotify). Just feel like something have to give amp; Google recognizes their own impotence with the comparatively basic functionality of their music player. Damn PAmp spoiled me lol.];[I dont think GMusic is a bad app per seits just that P-amp is far better. It handles Playlists better It has an equalizer I can edit song metadata on the device I like its look and feel better. Still, as things continue to progress, about 65 of my stuff is now online. I use GM more and more by necessity, P-amp less and less. Thats sure not my preference. I still do not know if GM will ever allow 3rd party integration, but if so, someone could sure do a better job than GM is doing of integrating offline and online music.Thats my biggest gripe with GM. It doesnt even show album covers of purchased MP3s purchased from someplace other than GM (and I find Amazon is usually cheaper...#33;) There should be some clear indicator (color coding? a little icon?) indicating when music is online only (I dont like to quot;hide unavailable...quot; or have to keep toggling) There should be some way to integrate playlists. If I create a list with both online and offline music, and Im not online, it should still function for whats available. As it is, however, if you use GM to add a song to an offline playlist, it basically then shows you only the online music forever more until you manually recopy the old the playlist to your SD card. I suspect one day this gets resolved. It would be nice to hear from the developers here. Re: the email I mentioned sending several weeks agono response whatsoever. Support here is never great.];[There is an unnoficial Google Music API. Poweramp could use it for accessing our songs and specially for making the mixes#33; https:github.coms...oogle-Music-API];
feature request: shake to skip, miui style lyrics	I love Poweramp. Its the only app Ive ever paid for, and its worth every penny. I think the feature set is adequate, but I noticed two really cool features in the stock MIUI music player (1.7.15 onwards) which, if incorporated into Poweramp would make this THE BEST app on the android market. The first is linking the accelerometer to skip the current song. Ive seen this in the most basic of players, so it would be really cool to have as when Im driving I dont want to have to unlock my phone to skip the current track. Should be able to shake little to skip the song, more to skip the playlist folder etc. The second, to automatically download and display scrolling karaoke style lyrics. MIUI does this really well, but I hate having some Chinese text show up randomly. The MIUI equalizer sucks, and this is the main reason why I love Poweramp - the sounds frikin amazing! Please try and include these two (rather rare) features in the next major release. Thanks, and keep up the amazing work!		30 July 2011 - 02:35 AM	ackshaey	[I agree with both features.

mono routing	Hi, I was looking for an application to listen play-a-long mp3 (Aebersold) where the drum is centered, while bass is on the left and the piano is on the right. So using the balance Ive the choice to remove the piano (which Im playing) while keeping drum and bass (I need pratically only the left channel for my job). I would like also to have a mono feature, so that I can hear this both on left and right headphone (and not only in one ear which it is not confortable while playing). I was happy to see that your application has both balance and mono (not quite diffused these controls among players) but unfortunately the current routing is, according to my test: mono -gt; balance (that means you first go mono than the balance does nothing) while could be more useful having: balance -gt; mono (first select the channel to be used among leftright, than put the risult in mono to hear this in both ears). This last routing has all the benefits of the currently implemented one, but has this extra possibility thats useful for my job. Having worked in mixer design I mean moving the balance control before (and not after) the mono block. Dont know if the actual routing specification (mono -gt; balance) has been done like that for a particular reason (please explain) but it looks to me that the other routing (balance -gt; mono) looks more flexible (hope to be right). Any comment ? Is there any chance to have this routing changed (swapped), so that also song called quot;minus onequot; has good choice to be played? Thanks in advance for your time.

auto dj functionality mode	One of the great features of Poweramp is its crossfading functionality (and gapless fading). It makes it much more DJ-like and much more fun to listen to music. Now how about adding a mode in which one just sees a playlist or folder list and with touching a specific list or folder it automatically begins playing the list without leaving that view. Currently one can press on the right hand side and options will appear (one of them is PLAY). You can even adjust in settings to not enter the list view and just begin playing the list from that view. However, Im talking about a special mode with a commercial focus. Lets say, you rent audio equipment for parties and wish to offer an integral solution for the music. A solid, fool proof mode for AutoDJ functionality where the customer cant exit the mode (a special gesture needed) and where he only sees lists genres folders which he can touch to begin playing them. It could also be used for automating music in your home. Imagine your tablet hanging on the wall, displaying just playlists or genres and with a press of a button it automatically begins playing music on the enabled sections of your home. Just an idea for the Poweramp programmers.		19 February 2012 - 04:44 PM	jk2000

time saving idea when building playlists	I have an idea to save users some a couple steps when building playlists. Currently, when a user long presses on a song, they have to select quot;Add to Playlistquot; then select a playlist from the list of existing playlists. It would be great time saver if a user you could long press a song then be given the option to add it to the most recently selected playlist. Possibly a dynamic menu option such as quot;Add to xxxquot; where xxx is the most recent playlist name. If there isnt a most recent playlist, this menu option would either not appear or ???.

Is there any way to display the time remaining in the bottom right of the player, instead of the total time of the track?		31 January 2012 - 02:15 AM	Nubzor	[No, but its easy to add, I just waited for such user request, and it looks, for a year+ timespan its the first one];[I would also like to see the ability to toggle between time remaining and time elapsed. Now you have two requests.];[I too would really like this option. I use this player to do a trivia show at a bar in which my phone is plugged directly into the house system. I give my trivia players a countdown when the song gets to about 45 seconds remaining and this would cut down a little math in my head. I know it sounds trivial but it helps.];
poll microphone pass through when paused	I sent this idea to Poweramp via email but was curious if other people thought this would be worthwhile. I use both in-ear-monitors and large headphones which I do not always want to take off when someone needs to talk to me briefly. Id love a feature that allows for sound from the mic to pass through into my headphones (if they are plugged in) when I hit the pause button. This way I can have a quick conversation and go back to listening without touching my headphones.

Still, were investigating possible workarounds.];
playlist lock screen audio buffer size	- Playlist in lock screen? Or same as Poweramp in non lock screen? - 750ms is a bit slow. 500 ms fill buffer? Or just play and read whole mp3 when start playing song?		15 February 2012 - 05:10 PM	hanz	[1. do you mean you have a request for playlist in lock screen? 2. +750ms is added for Huge buffer. Actual buffer size is not a constant and depends on phone hardware, ROM, file type. Note that we tested Poweramp on Normal (default) buffer size on all our test devices (40+ most popular android devices) and on all of them this is enough, higher buffer values means something is already wrong with the phoneROM (heavy cpu consuming background appsservices, too fragmented sd card, etc). Decoding whole mp3 is not possible on mobile device and is not needed at all. Audio buffer size is not related to decoding at all, audio buffer is required by android os itself as OS cant keep up with the small buffer values (as iOS or, for example, PC can).];
playlist sort option - artistalbumtrack #?	I was wondering, seeing as how theres already an artistalbum sort option in playlists (which sorts by artist, then album, but then puts the album tracks in alphabetical order), would it be maybe a good idea to have an additional sort option called artistalbumtrack # that would put tracks in a playlist in the quot;rightquot; order? I know its a little obsessive, but I can generally fault so little with Poweramp, but this one tiny feature would be pretty awesome for me.		14 February 2012 - 09:18 AM	izza	[menu (while in any list) =gt; List Opts =gt; Sort. You can also re-sort user created playlists. Thanks#33;];[Yeah, what I meant was a specific playlist sorting option to organise songs by artist, then by album, then by track number. You can currently organise by artist, then by album, but the tracks are then sorted alphabetically, which is a minor nuisance (this is what happens when you go menu - sort - by artistalbum while in a playlist). Itd be nice just to have that third level of sorting, ie. a playlist sort option called quot;By artistalbumtrack #quot;. If you say its too much work for a little, nitpicky thing, alright, but I wanna at least make sure you know what I mean first.];
menu access	I need a way to access the Setup Menu other than using the MENU button at the top of the screen. My Android is a Set Top box and, probably related having a 1080P display, they have disabled access to the Menu Icon.		10 February 2012 - 07:03 AM	jgbrown54	[How can you do anything on an Android device without access to the Menu function?#33; Andre];[Its not easy but you had better get used to it because its going away for everyone in Android 3 in favor of the Action Bar and Action Overflow Button. See http:android-devel...enu-button.html That means that every app that currently relys on the Menu button will have to be updated if they want to stay compatible. Once they update, then those of us that have older versions of Android with a Menu button will have a button that doesnt do much. Or maybe well all have to buy new phones and tablets. The device I have is running Android 2.3.4 and does not have a Menu button. I wonder if they jumped ahead and removed it in 2.3.4 instead of waiting for Android 3 to come out? Does anyone out there have Android 2.3.4 that does have a Menu button? The top line of my screen only has a Status bar that shows the time and the status of things like Blue Tooth, WiFi, and Network. No Menu button or Action Overflow button. Clicking anywhere on the bar only displays the date for a short period. I was just reading the Android 2.3.4 User Manual. If you look at the screen print pictures throughout the manual, you will notice that the Menu button icon is indeed missing from the top StatusNotifiation bar. It does talk about using the Menu button so it must be referring to devices with a dedicated button. It also says that it can be accessed from the Home screen. Unfortunately, the manufacturer of my device put in their own Home screen and it does not have a Menu button on it. That wouldnt help me get to the Options within an Application anyway.];[How stupid is that. The WHOLE reason I decided to down go the Android route rather than iPhone was the proper tactile buttons, physical keyboard options, etc. I ideally want to keep Home, Back and Menu (not bothered about Search) away from the capacitive screen completely if possible, as I keep hitting the bottom on the screen rather than the buttons. Such functions certainly dont belong near the top of the screen cluttered up around information icons. Andre];[On my Set Top media player, I use a Bluetooth keyboard with a built-in touch pad. I found out, quite by accident, that the center mouse button, taping the touchpad with 2 fingers, activates the Action Bar allowing me access to the settings.];

larger audio buffer for hard drive devices	Using an Archos 80 g9 250gb. I know there arent too many hard-drive based Android devices, but the market is certainly there for those of use with very large media collections. Id love to have an additional buffer setting beyond the quot;large, 750msquot; because this buffer still is not large enough to give the hard drive time to spin up. I would hope its an easy fix... I would assume the buffer requires at minimum several secondsheres hoping its as simple as changing one number in the code. Problem experienced: only with higher bitrate MP3 files (200kbps to 320kbps) every 5 seconds it will pause and artifact. Note, FLAC and lower bitrate MP3 files all appear to work fine, which leads me to believe there must be a simple solution for this.

expand context menus	Iconic buttons only give you two choices. Press and Long Press. By expanding the Long Press into a Context Menu, additional selections could be added. One that I have noticed is when doing a Long Press on the title, I am taken to the Library. From there I can go to Folders.Im also taken into the Library with the current list. What if I would rather be able to Long Press the title and I was given a choice of where I wanted to go. There are also several existing Buttons that currently do not have a context menu on a Long Press.

Though, Im thinking about adding option to force Poweramp lock screen even if music is not playing in Poweramp. This will require Poweramp service to be loaded in all times.

longpress volume rocker control volume, short press switch tracks	When the screen is off, and on the lock screen widget, it would be a dramatic improvement to add a function to longpress volume keys to change the volume (in 13 second increments) , and short press to change the track. Also like in PlayerPro, it would be sweet to be able to swich functionality (longpress for track change, short press for volume up=next, down=previous). This is a feature that I love and is a must for when I go jogging. Curently only PlayerPro has it, and have it down PERFECTLY but the audio engine sucks. Would like very much to keep using Poweramp with this **crucial** feature. I love Poweramps audio engine over all other players and therefore not having this control makes Poweramp incomplete for me. This seems to be a common issue among Android users that are not running Cyanogen Mod.		05 February 2012 - 09:16 AM	Krazie316	[That function already exists, it can be enabled in Settings gt; Misc gt; Headset gt; Respond to Headset Buttons (check the box).

changable artwork with customized locations	Hey. First of all this is great application. So great job#33; Secondly, some people who use foobar with certain artwork plugins, know of that feature. This is so that artwork changes with random(or fixed depended on the setting) time intervals, and changes either in linear or random way. Is it possible you couldmake this feature, so that the artwork of the song changes? Currently there is one image that is quot;assignedquot; to the song or the album and thats it. But for those (like me ) who did spend their time on doing image collections for the albums to shuffle through artwork constantly this would be a great feature. For it to work though, you would also add a configurable folder sellection. To be more precise, it would be very bad idea, to have say 20 different images in the same folder as the sound files. It wouldnt look good, it wouldbt be also good idea from organising stand of point. What I have for instance, is in the album folder, I have a folder named ArtWork, and inside it I have only the images, that are displayed in random order, when the songs from that album are played. However it can be any name of the folder, or even folders if you wish. Its all customizable, again. Anyways, any chance you guys might think of that and implement it in some future versions? cheers Lucas		15 January 2012 - 11:04 PM	soyo	[Good, bad, terrible idea?];

bring back old skins and layout option please.	I paid for the full version of Poweramp a long time ago and loved it. Shortly afterwards 2.0 came out and I feel like I wasted my money since then. The old skin layout was vastly superior. The skins themselves were much more attractive (mainly quot;White Plasticquot;). Please put a little time and effort into the skins. 2.0 is nice featurewise, but it looks like the skins were just thrown together. A major reason I nitpick so much on the skins is that I used Poweramp as a car audio player. Which leads me to another point: the 2.0 Poweramps landscape skin mode is nowhere near as functional for that purpose.		22 January 2012 - 04:28 AM	crunchb3rry	[Id be happy if they reworked the landscape too.

So what you do mean (as I understand) is that you want a smart-playlsit for Composer which upon the time of library scan (and with support for extended metadata) would categorically scan+detect the Composer tag of found audio files and store the info in an Composer smart-playlist for which upon entering the smart-playlist can be sorted by Composers name etc];[To be honest, I made a mistake in this: my fault that I didnt see before that Browse by Composer is a feature already available in the current version of Poweramp, its just disabled by default but can be enabled via config. I apologize for not having seen it before opening the thread.];

96khz alac	Can proper support of 24 bit 96 kHz Apple Lossless files be added? Since the codec is now open source and FLAC audio files of this quality are supported, I dont imagine this feature to be difficult to implement.		12 January 2012 - 06:16 PM	suhaybh	
please have 9624 19224 file support...please	I have quite a number of 9624 files purchased with Weiss Saracon upsampled or orginially recorded 9624.

swipe abilities	I am really missing swipe abilities for moving between Folders Player Library. That way, it would just feel so much more authentic and natural. Here are some ideas on the execution. In the Folders view it shouldnt be a problem, since swiping left and right isnt used in any way. The same goes for the Library. The only problem might be in the Player view, which uses swiping to change songs. But still, its used just in Coverflow, so there is place where the buttons are and where song info such as a title and artist is. I have seen these swipe capabilities in so many apps so I guess it should not be that big a problem. Would be glad to see that#33; Cheers, Battlefield		09 January 2012 - 11:04 AM	Battlefield	[Agreed, swiping between different menulibary screens would be great. Andre];

tag as resumable	It would be nice to be able to tag a file as resumable so that it remembers the last position you were at. This way I could manually tag mixes, audiobooks and podcasts and when I reload them carry off from where I left.

I have a rather pricey, and large 128 CB card.

Ill consider this option, but it seems unfortunate that I may have to re-copy 120GB+ of data - and I still have some reservations about re-formatting - on the off chance there is a problem (then again, I dont like the proprietary filesystem...) lt;pgt;EDIT: Actually, I reformatted it ext2 and it works fine.

auto song identify	I would LOVE it if Poweramp had a song identifying feature like Mixzing, so I could just click and get the song title and other info instead of having to go back and forth between Soundhound and the player. That is Mixzings one amazing feature. Also it would be cool if it Poweramp had more smart playlist features, its cool that there a rating system but whats the point if I cant choose to listen to only the 5s or 4s, other touches like, Least Played or Top 10, 20,50 would rather take the player over the top and keep it ahead of the other players		02 January 2012 - 11:46 AM	ZuZu	
pass thru mode with nothing touching the signal except da and amplification	Before I bought Poweramp I gave it a listen. My old phone was a Nexus One, and when I listened to songs on it, I thought the midrange was more lifelike and had a lot more presence and texture. When I played the same song on my new Galaxy Nexus using Poweramp I was disappointed in the sound. When I played it on the Galaxy Nexus using the stock music player it was closer to the Nexus One, it was better in the midrange. I suspect I had a Poweramp setting that was colouring the sound. Or maybe the Nexus One player was colouring the sound. In any event Id like a direct setting that turns off everything but DAC and amplification, the proverbial straight wire with gain. It would usually be used for classical, or when you wanted to compare to another source. Now, I dont know what DACs the two phones have, and how they should compare. Ive spend a lot of time and money on audio equipment with Burr-Browns but never looked at smartphones. Unfortunately Im too discriminating and picky when it comes to sound. But I will find some time to listen a little more systematically.		31 December 2011 - 04:00 AM	skelly.larry@gmail.com	[Try disabling Direct Volume Control and turn off Eq, Tone and Limit.];

Only solution I see right now is to put podcasts and music into different folders and use different players but that is a pain especially using iSyncer. I have been using bTunes and it use to work great for podcasts and music. Here lately it has been force closing, opening for no reason and developing a few other bugs. It seems as though the developer has entered the witness protection program so updates are a thing of the past. bTunes used track length to differentiate between music and podcastsaudiobooks.];[Thanks for the requests.

show by album artist	Hi, I have a lot of albums that are collaborations of different artists which clutters my album view. Could you add a feature to view albums by album artist?		29 November 2010 - 06:11 PM	jSherz	[Thanks for the request. Its possible to see albums by artist now, but each album will have full song list, not just that artists songs. Current dev. builds show only artists songs in artist albums and this will be in the next update on the market.];[Thanks for the program, its really excellent. This feature quot;album by artistquot; seems to help some people, but it doesnt really get me past the problems I have with music players on Android. Its already available on PowerPro (which I also bought hoping implemented it differently than it actually did). For example, if you buy an Eminem albumsaying nothing of my taste in musicyou have an album where pretty much every song has a different artist. So track one is Eminem and Obie Trice, track two is Eminem and Wayne Newton, track three is by Dr. Dre and Eminem, so on and so forth. Now, when I list quot;Album by Artistquot; I have an additional 15 artists. Throw in a couple of 80s compilations, and now my list is unmanageable. The same happens for sorting by quot;Artist.quot; Listing by quot;Albumquot; helps somewhat, but I have too many albums and a bad memory for what Albums are called. Possibly I have a broken through process, but I sort music by the artist in my head; so if I want to listen to Early Days - Led Zeppelin, I have to struggle to remember is it Greatest Hits, Early Hits, Hits?. I just dont remember album names that well, possibly because there are so many more of them. I find it very difficult to use music programs in Android the way theyre structured. Album Artist solves this problem by limiting the number of possible selections to an small, manageable list of artists in a group that seems easy to manage. Right now I have either several hundred albumsI have a 32GB card in my phoneor several hundred artists; album artist distills this list down into maybe a third of that number and makes my music much more accessible. I dont know why other people dont seem to have this problem, or maybe they just dont put a premium on accessibility; I find it crucial if Im linking the phone to the car speakers, for example. Anyway, Poweramp is an excellent program Im very happy to have bought. The UI is definitely the best of all of the music players Ive tried. And the library system is great tooI love being able to restrict myself to certain folders so my Car Talk podcasts dont end up in my music player. I keep wishing for quot;Album Artistquot; so that I can really take advantage of that new feature. Thanks.];

volume control bar	Hi#33;My Poweramp was updated automatically yesterday.And a BIG BIG problem that I have is that there is no (good) new volume control bar#33;You can activate the volume menue while taping once on the album art, but I think there should be a customization which allows to see this option always on top (not over the CD cover gt;.lt;) just at the bottom or something like that. Like it was before.I used the Poweramp software volume switch EVERY time AND I could see exaytly(At the volume level bar that appears) how the volume is set.

With the new skin, the way I use my phone (in landscape mode) I have to have the permanent controls turned off to see the album art, and it looks very good this way.

I use iSyncr to sync from iTunes to my phone, and iTunes populates a constantly-fresh set of playlists that are totally dependent on song ratings to function.];[Preliminary support for iSyncr would be great but of course not constant support. This should be re-considered Max. So far users have also asked for related Ratings support: -mediamonkey -songbird -helium music manager];[Thanks for the +1.

Stay with your ipod and search some other appropriate forum.];[the point of the post is a list of basic usability issues, hence a feature request to have them addressed in particular: add a feature to scroll, wrap, or telescope long names in the library, rather than just truncating them. truncation means that 2 entries with different names cant be told apart. the htc player also truncates add a skip in shuffle feature. you otherwise have to manually skip non music tracks that pop up when shuffling. the htc player doesnt have this either add ability to sort on artist and album sort fields. it can sort on year, and automatically skips quot;Thequot; prefixes, so its already an improvement on the htc player add a feature to auto-select the only album when selecting artist. this is just a nice usability enhancement. the htc player doesnt do this either add a feature to remove redundant identical artist and album names for each track from the track list. it really looks cluttered otherwise, distracts from the track titles, and takes up more space. the htc player shows the artist but not the album for each track add a feature to show remaining time. pretty basic feature. the htc player can do this Im actually using the htc player at the moment, mention of the ipod is just for a well-known, old, reference for basic features and usability I think you protest too much, are you a closet ipod user?];[Lots of good points there. Mostly fairly simple, definitely non-critical, stuff, but good for adding to the wishlist. None are really deal-breakers though. I rarely use the Library options myself to be honest, I mostly use folderfile navigation.

Andre];[itunes supports artist and album sort fields, so although you dont get much flexibility otherwise, you can at least fully control the sort order. the android media library doesnt seem to support these fields, but as power amp is using its own scanner, it could support extracting them from the id3 tags and giving them as a sort option youre right about just using folders though, thanks, that works for me too, as I have my folder structure using the artist and album sort names already the main annoyance of the htc player Im using now, apart from a total lack of sort options, is always switching back to the top of the artist list, you cant just go back up from the current track, so power amp is an improvement on both of those issues (not to mention lossless support) thanks for the eq tip too, I hadnt noticed the toggle switches before, only the reset button. Ill remove that from the list so yeah, the rest are pretty much minor usability enhancements, as you say, no deal breakers, just makes it a little nicer to use. skip in shuffle is important though for anyone who has non-music tracks and uses shuffle. you can work around it with play lists but its not pretty Ill keep using it until the end of the trial period, but it looks like Ill purchase then as the folder navigation and (implicit) sort functions are enough of an improvement over the htc player (and the 10 billion downloads market promotion has seduced me into finally adding my credit card to the market...)];
searching song by typing on keyboard	Hi, i wasnt sure whether to raise it as a bug or put it as new feature so have added it here anyway. I dont remember the previous version of Poweramp in which it was working but in the songs list when i type my songs name using the keypad, it used to show the keys typed and would narrow down the list. It is not working after a particular update a month or so back so would rather want such a feature on the latest build if possible.

albumplaylist specific randomize	Since theres the option to set equalizer settings to a specific filealbumplaylist I think it wouldnt be too difficult to do something similar with albumsplaylist and playback options such as randomize or something like that. Of all my albums there is only one that i like randomized and its quite difficult to remember to switch the playback option every time I switch albums. Another idea to do that (since I cant seem to think of any other usability to an album specific playback options) is to make a feature that would change the track number of every file in an album to a random one.		08 December 2011 - 04:07 PM	swistaq	
extended title scrolling	If Ive noted correctly it looks like if the title of the song andor the artistalbum title of the song are longer than the screen then it looks like they will scroll for the first 30 or so seconds of when a second starts, when a song is paused then continued, and if the app is put in the background and then brought back to the screen. Im assuming if both song title and artistalbum title are long they alternate scrolling during that period. One of the things I use to like about my Zune HD was that in play mode the screen saver would continuously scroll these titles (I have alot of long titles). Id love to see an option that would allow you to turn on the ability to continue to scroll those titles (alternating between the two lines scrolling if necessary) for the duration of the song instead of just during the startup periods Ive noted above.		08 December 2011 - 02:25 PM	DarienA

in folder view	I think this feature was removed in version 2.x. In folder view, that I often use, when I tap on a song the UI jumps back to the Play modescreen which isnt an ideal behaviour since Id still want to choose another song to listen to instead of the last selected song.

support for google music	Hi Is it possible to add support for Google Music, so I can stream all my uploaded music in Poweramp? I know Google Music is in its beta state, so it would probably take some time before you can start thinking about this (unless youve got beta access).		28 May 2011 - 12:32 AM	chreddy	[Yes, Im pretty sure this is really important feature. If there are plans to support Google Music?];[+1];[I have to disagree for a few reasons:1) Last I knew it didnt have an open developer API. So max would have to reverse engineer it, which takes a lot of time and could piss off Google.2) Google claims that Google Music is "free for a limited time", but that implies it will eventually be a paid service. Id rather have one-time fee than paying a few dollars per month to access my music that Ive already paid for - a few dollars per month adds up.To offer alternatives that get around both of these cons, there are other free cloudstreaming music services such as Audiogalaxy or Subsonic which are free or have a one-time server fee, respectively. Audiogalaxy has a developer API and Subsonic is open source, so there wouldnt be any reverse-engineering involved in either. Ampache is another open source alternative (but isnt as friendly to set up). Both have all of the features of Google Music (web-interface, streaming), plus Subsonic has a podcast tab.One might argue that these alternatives are differentinferior because they require your own computer to act as the server. All I can say is thats a valid opinion.];[+1 I hope Poweramp can support Google Music.

queue management	I like the new dynamic queue but I think theres some room for improvement. The best queue management Ive seen is at grooveshark.com. Several desktop music players have similar control but grooveshark does it with the best visual flair (unfortunately not everything they do is as beautiful).The most important feature here is the ability to select a song to play: [*:3hqp9zpu]now (inserts it into the slot immediately following the current song in the queue and advances to it)[*:3hqp9zpu]next (inserts it into the next slot like the play now option but doesnt advance to it until the current song finishes)[*:3hqp9zpu]and last (inserts it after the last song in the queue)The queue doesnt delete songs once they have been played so it acts as a record of the songs played in that session.It is fully re-orderable and traversible. In grooveshark you can reorder with drag and drop and click on any item to switch to it.The queue can be manually cleared (or have items removed from it), and it can be its state can be saved as a playlist.This has many benefits beyond graphical niceness. It allows you to have more transparency about how the app is picking songs. If you code it so that the shuffle button shuffles the queue (instead of randomly traversing it) you can see what songs are coming up and edit them if you like. It makes it infinitely easier to make a playlist, giving you the option to fiddle to your hearts content before saving.Id be happy to provide screen-shots of groovesharks example and answer any questions		07 February 2011 - 11:36 PM	askeeve	[Yepp the played songs in the queue are flaged and greyed out, but this does not seem to have any effect...];
no shuffle in queue	Hi, I have a feature proposal regarding the current queue implementation and shuffle mode. Although I still think the current approach to song queuing may be a bit too complicated and confusing for many people (see some of the confused reactions in the forums) it has its advantages and could become even more useful with a simple feature addition. Currently when you play a folder with shuffle on and enqueue an album you need to turn off shuffle manually in order to play the album (or custom song selection) in the right or desired order. On top of that when the queue finishes always the SECOND song in the original folder (the one you had playing on shuffle) starts to play. This is fairly logical but quite annoying. What I suggest is an OPTION not the shuffle songs added to the queue even when shuffle (either folder or library based) is turned on globally. This way I could listen to a folder of random songs or the whole library on shuffle and when I thought of a specific album or selection of songs to play I could just enqueue them, listen to them in the order I DESIRE (even manipulate the queue in the process) and after the queue is finished return to playing the original folder or whole library on shuffle all without ever having to touch the shuffle switch and having to listen to the second second in the original folder for the millionth time. I think this is a reasonable suggestion that would immensely enhance the user experience. Please consider it. Thanks! Petr		24 March 2011 - 10:26 AM	ego42	[Thanks for the request. Btw, v1.3 includes option not to return back to list from queue (if queue ends, it will just finish playing). Thanks!];[I can see its included in the 2.0 update and its awesome#33; Thanks a lot for implementing this#33; Petr];[But it does not work correctly, before I could shuffle songs in the queue, so that each song was only played once and playback would stop when all songs are played.

please modify the function of the volume buttons#33;	Hello guys, I think I created a similar thread for that some months ago, but I aint sure no more. So sorry for creating this one. PowerMP is really a great app and Im so happy that I bought it. However, please fix this volume button problem that is unfortunately an Android problem#33; Its such a pity that the volume gets increaseddecreased so inaccurately when you press the volume buttons. PowerMP has a master volume bar and an extra volume bar. These options give users a perfect possibility to adjust their favorite volume. Well, but many users dont hold their cell phones in their hands when theyre listening to music. Pressing the volume buttons is never a problem, though, but its almost useless since its so inaccurate. Itd be perfect if PowerMP had an option that lets you adjust how many percent the volume gets increaseddecreased when you press the specific volume button or for example to set up the volume steps, 64 instead of 16, or 32 instead of 16 etc. Please, we aint no dogs that could hear any theoretical quality loss since someone mentioned 16 was a perfect number to adjust volume, it just aint#33; If that was true, all the MP3 players out there would have hearable quality loss cause they got more than 16 volume steps. Honestly guys, I cant see that ugly green Android volume bar no more - it makes me angry and sick#33; All those Apple guys laugh at Androids ridiculous volume system We should teach em a lesson#33; I got a Samsung Galaxy S2 with Android 2.3.4 and the newest version of PowerMP and the unlocker of course.

genre request	Hello, Most of the time I listen to music while driving my daily route to work and back. Operating your phone while driving is not recommandable, so anything you do should be without to much hassle. When I want to listen to some music, I usually do this by choosing the genre (which reflects more or less the mood Im in;-), then the album, then select the entire album for playing or a specific song within that album. Heres my problem: I have 200+ albums on my sdcards, containing 2500+ songs, all tagged with genre. When going in through genre, it shows all songs in that genre. Since some genres contain hundreds of songs, it is almost impossible to scroll through, especially when driving. Would it be possible to have an option to choose whether you want a list of the albums (and then songs) or just songs when entering your library via genre?

playlists ....again; how about option to create m3us automatically?	Hi....from looking around I see that playlists are a constant topicthe inability to easily backup in Android and the awkward creation is a continuing pain. With 10 year old technology on a Palm Treo, it is faster and simpler using programs like Ptunes. The recent change in the way playlists was handled was a nice and thoughtful improvement, a step in the right direction, but only a step. At least now it is POSSIBLE to deal with playlists on the device. It is still awkward enough so that I wind up creating them from my desktop, and that shouldnt have to be. The key problem is that I want to keep them both backed up and in a universally useable format (like m3u or whatever) that I can use across devices and systems. The new feature allowing creation and then export to m3u or similar is a reliefnow its possible at least. But my question is....why the multi-step process? When you go to create a playlist, why cant it simply ask you (or allow you to have predefined options) how you want it done? Let it go through the creationconversionexport process in the background if that is how Android has to fumble around, but I should be able to create a useable and backup-pable playlist from the get go, not have to go through this 5 step process: (1) create on device; 2. go into Poweramp settings; 3 choose to exportconvert to a useable format I can control and backup; 4 delete the original creation, since clearly I dont need dupes; and finally; 5 move the exportedconverted format into the folder where I keep my actual useable and backup-pable playlists. Thats 5 steps. It could just be that when you go to create a playlist, it simply asks you where you want to save it and in what format (or you predefine those preferenceseven better#33;). Done. No muss, no fuss. If Android doesnt allow that in one step,. since the program clearly has the ability to export and convert now, let that process go on invisibly behind the scenes, eliminating all the user-annoying steps outlined above. Thanks for listening. P.s. Along a similar concern on backing upwhen you edit tags, if you then copy the song back to your desktop, does the tag remain? Or is that just from the playlist?		27 November 2011 - 02:04 PM	monsieurms

buy poweramp in euro currency, and other question	Bonjour from France, newbie on the Poweramp soft and on this forum. 1 Id like to know if it is possible to pay for Poweramp at a Poweramp account in Euro, and if yes - what is the process ?Poweramp managers must know that many potential customers in Europ are inhibited by this problem of payment by US dollars...If really No other way to pay, is Paypal accepted to receive money ? 2 Ill wish to use Poweramp in 2 or 3 devices of my home : my Desktop in my desk at the first floor, my netbook in my bedroom, my tablet always in my pocket.Buying a licence allows me to have the use of Poweramp in my 3 home computers ? 3 some friends (as I do) worries about payment, as here and there it is said that payment are not followed by having the users right of Poweramp.Understand that itsnt a good advertisement for the besides of this excellent software product. Point 1 and point 3 are two problems that operate like a quot;brakequot; freezing many European people to buy and use Poweramp(personally, I do wish to get Poweramp, but for 2 years now, I am sticked with Winamp). I sincerely wish to get some answers to this 3 points.In advance, I thank you #33;		26 November 2011 - 12:27 PM	Jobim

beats audio dsp integration	I really love your app, its without a doubt the best player available IMHO. Ive been a long time user, I have purchased the full license. I recently bought a Rezound. I really like the Beats audio DSP, but as of right now it only works with the default music player. In my opinion, that player sucks, its not nearly as good as Power Amp. I have heard that the source code for the Beats audio has been released, so developers can integrate support for this feature in their apps. Are their any plans to incorporate this into Power Amp?		24 November 2011 - 09:37 PM	nelamvr6	[Absolutely.

editing also artist, album and other tags	I bought in march Poweramp; it was a really good player but after some time i noticed that it still missed some useful features that one player i found had. Now Poweramp with the last update became again the best and i started again to use it, but it still miss one thing that to me would be really really useful: now its possible to edit the info of the songs, but it would be great if we could edit multiple elements like the name of an artist for every song with that artist (i mean, maybe i wrote by mistake The Beetles insted of The Beatles on the pc, but i can edit all my 100 song with one single tap without the need of editing them one by one) I hope youll understand my bad english, if you dont, ask me and ill try to explain better what i wanted to say		03 November 2011 - 11:49 AM	Sciacallo010	[Thanks for the request.

auto-change folder, etc	Suggestion1: Since there#180;s always someone who will prefer to manually go to the next folder, it could be configurable in settings. Suggestion2: when unpluggingplugging again the headphones, can we preserve the volume setting? Right now, if I change the volume with the headphone connected, disconnect and reconnect, the volume resets to a fixed volume. This happens even if I change the volume when the headphone is disconnected. I am listing this here as a suggestion, but to be honest I don#180;t know if this is a bug in Poweramp (probably not), bug or intended behavior in Android 2.3.4 (who knows), or in my phone (Samsung Galaxy S2, brazilian ver, no carrier customization, no fooling with custom rom).

Also, will the ability to bookmark ever be implemented?];[I am confident that if you implement an effective FF RW and an option to bookmarkresume where left off on exit, your player will sell like crazy. Many of us who love the player for music hate having to switch to something else for other types of audio (plus the equalizer is invaluable for all types of audio files) - with these improvements Poweramp will be by far the best payer available on android for audio (music and other) and sales will be commensurate.];[PowerAMP already saves the file position, but this happens only for last file. Im thinking about adding position saving for any other previous songs as well (so if you change the track in the middle and then return back, it will continue playing from the exact stored position) - not sure if this makes sense for music playing, so it will be optional.];[Making the resume system handle multiple tracks would be nice, but please could it be an option? i.e. something like "Remember playback position: None | Current Track | All Tracks". Hiding this sort of thing away within the options keeps the main interface nice and clean, but still gives flexibilty and choice to power users (no pun intended, LOL). Oh, and one very minor thing to go along with this - please could the first action of the Track Back () button be to go back to the start of the current track, rather than going immediately to the previous track, then second press would go to the previous track? Thanks. I too would really love FFwdFRwd via the buttons too - both in the player interface screen widget, but even more so via the headeset buttons. So on the headset cable I could use Single-click for Track ++, double-click for Folder +- and long press for fast-forwardfast-rewind. Again, could the speed be made an option? Something like 3x, 5x, 10x, 15x and Variable (which would get faster the longer you held the button down). Im really loving this program, and thanks for listening to user feedback. Andre];[As an avid audiobook listener, bookmarking is the number one feature that Im looking for.

Scrubbing is a feature of the iPod application on Apple devices. The only feature that made me go wow. You use the progress bar to seek a point in the song. But many a times it is not possible to reach a point in a track to the exact second. And you make do with listening to a few extra seconds of the track. Now imagine listening to an audio book and you would realize the need for scrubbing. Move your finger as you would normally seek in the progress bar AND move your finger away from the progress bar to vary the sensitivity of progression. The result would be 32x, 16x, 8x, 4x, 2x speeds for seek.];[Bump#33;];[Agreed, seeking to an accurate position within a long track, or skipping forwards or backwards by controlled increments (e.g. 30 second jumps) is sadly one of PowerAmps weakest areas.

lists not ordered correctly (or the way i would like it)	Hi, Im a new Android user and new Poweramp user. Ive tried many alternatives over the past week or two and Poweramp seems to be by far the cleanest, smothest music experience. Congrats on a great piece of software#33; There are just two things that are bugging me a little bit and they have to with ordering of songs. (Im sorry if this post gets confusing from here but its not that easy to explain#33;). When you order a list by title its seems to do - Symbols gt; # gt; A-Z and it does not ignore opening brackets. So for example my Albums list appears: (Whats the Story) Morning Glory by Oasis ...And Justice For All by Metallica 1984 by Van Halen The A Team by Ed Sheeran Absolution by Muse I think the correct way to order this list (which is the way an iPodiPhone does it) would be to ignore symbols completely and start with the first letter of the first word. Also to order it A-Z gt; # rather than # gt; A-Z. Secondly, in the All Songs list it does not ignore words like The and A so tracks like quot;A Groovy Kind of Love by Phil Collinsquot; will appear under the quot;Aquot; section rather than quot;Gquot;. This is not consistent with the behaviour shown in the Artists or Albums view where an album such as quot;The Battle of Los Angeles by RATMquot; will appear under quot;Bquot; (quite correctly). All this would change my list above to: The A Team by Ed Sheeran Absolution by Muse ...And Justice For All by Metallica ... ***All albums from A-W*** then.... ... (Whats the Story) Morning Glory by Oasis ... *** All albums from W-Z*** then... ... 1984 by Van Halen Anyway, Im sure that was as clear as mud#33; I wonder what the other forum goers think and whether you could add this behaviour to sort lists?

eq presets to be saved for album even when listening to playlists?	Let me explain my situation; I have tons of albums on my Poweramp, however, I usually listen to them on playlists (like All songs or created playlists). When listening to an album and you want to change EQ for all its songs its very easy, because its in the choices when you save an EQ for any of its songs. However, when listening to playlists, and you want to change the EQ of the song youre listening to, you can do it and save it - but you cant do it for its whole album, only its playlist. Why this is so important to me: Many of my albums play at different volumes, so its a huge pain in the ass to lower the volume or raise after every song, and with EQ you can save a particular volume so all songs would be leveled. But since one album usually has one particular volume level, it would be extremely useful if you could save EQ for the whole album even from the playlist. So I ask - would this be hard to add? Basically when you save EQ for the song in a playlist, could there be a choice for quot;albumquot;? Please, if its easy to do, it would be EXTREMELY useful for me.		11 November 2011 - 03:30 PM	defecz

more columns in grid view (to display more albums at once)	First off, I would just like to say that Poweramp is the most complete and best-looking mobile music player I have ever used. I have used it for about a year now, and I like it better than Zune, Sansa, any other Android music player, and needless to say the iPhoneiPods limited and extremely overrated players. The introduction of Grid View in Poweramp 2.0 is great, but I wish it would display more albums at once. On a fundamental level, displaying album art is much easier to recognize than displaying text - if you know your album covers as well as I do. But in my case, Grid View becomes difficult to use with 160+ albums and only two columns. Currently I can display six albums at once on my 4quot; Samsung Captivate screen (with my LCD density set to 165, as opposed to the supremely oversized Samsung default of 240). I am suggesting a 3, 4, or even 5 column view which would roughly allow me to display 12-25 albums on the screen at once. I can already hear everybody screaming, quot;No, the album art thumbnails will be way too small#33;quot; But think about it. If I can scroll through 160 albums with a single flick of my finger, not only does it look cool, but most importantly it is functional. As Android users, we are already used to it - it would be like an App Drawer for our music player#33; I realize its easy for us as users to come up with a million different features we all want, but if you at least consider an expanded Grid View, consider me a happy user.		11 November 2011 - 02:58 AM	SchecterRocker	
need my easy folder view back#33; pleease#33;	Before 2.0, you could be listening to an album(folder) and, with a long-press on the titlecounter, you could go back to the folder list and switch to another album. Now that long-press brings up ArtistAlbumFolder pop-up. Pressing quot;folderquot; takes you to the CURRENT folder. Then, you can hit quot;folderquot; again, or press the top of the screen, and it will finally take you to the list. The best way I can figure out to get back to the list in 2.0 is to hit the MENU key(Droid x) then hit Folders. At any rate, its become more of a chore to switch folders, especially for someone, like me, who does most of their listening while driving.. This, and the problem with the albumart.jpg files not showing up, makes going from the old, nearly flawless, Poweramp to 2.0 pretty disappointing. Im sure the albumart bug will be fixed, but I REALLY hope you can streamline the folder switching. Maybe an option to go back to the old long-press method? Or is there something Im missing?? Thank you#33;		07 November 2011 - 01:58 AM	swrives	[Thanks for the feedback. Right, long press on song info now has extra 3 lists instead of the parent folders list.

I have albumart.jpgs in every one of my folders and they all worked perfectly before the update.

total list time	Hi Max. I was wondering if it would be possible to include a feature that allows total list times to be displayed. For example, in library view, under a given playlist or album, in addition to listing the number of tracks, could you list the total play time?

static noise while changing songs automatically (prev next)	I hear static noise while Poweramp (2.0) changes from one song to another. if i change the song to next or previous manually i dont hear this static noise. i hope you have the time to look into this cos i simply love this app. I was previously using Poweramp version 1.4 build 387 and never experienced any problems or any static noises. Actually this was my most probable reason (along with many other of coz) why i chose Poweramp cos the integration of this player with the ROM is seamless and the sound is superb.

And the fact Poweramp 1.4 worked fine (although no DVT) is why i expected 2.0 to blow me away. Not much of a problem if you are entirely lost in the music. But sometimes it does kill the mood.

volume buttons	Hi friends, Congratz regarding V 2.0. I have two questionsrequests: Is it possible that you remove the standard function of the volume buttons? There is an app called Minesweeper (the game with the mines). The newest version of that games changes the volume buttons so that you can use them for other games. I thought it might be possible that Poweramp can also change their functions. The standard Android volume bar is pretty lame because it is too inaccurate. Poweramp 2 features much better volume control. If the volume buttons could control Poweramps volume, it would be great. There is also a tool called quot;Fine Volume Control 2quot;. You can check that too. Im not sure if you devs can benefit from such programs in case youre able to see the source code. The other question: Is that new volume bar in Poweramp 2 the same as the master equalizer? If I press the volume buttons so that the lame android volume control comes up, I see that the volume bar of Poweramp changes too. So if I change the Poweramp volume bar myself (without the buttons) it looks like I can change the volume very accurately. Is this really true or just fake?^^ P.S. My cellphone: Samsung Galaxy S2 with Android 2.3.4. Thanks		04 November 2011 - 08:47 PM	Galaxy_S2_User	
web based control	Good evening#33; I updated to the new pro version and it is great#33; Runs very good on my SGS 2, thanks for your work#33; My idea for a new feature is to add a web based GUI for controlling Poweramp. I dont know if some people think the same, for me it would be a nice feature. I put my mobile on dock at home and connect it to my amplifier by bluetooth. Everytime I like to change an track or something I must go trough my rooms and select it. If there is a web GUI (for example with a StartStop option), you can connect to the phone and controll things like nextprevious track, folder updown and all the things you can in a widget. I thik, this would be a nice feature. I dont know, is it possible yet with the API you provide? Or as a plugin for the PAW server? Regards BoRsTiE		03 November 2011 - 06:57 PM	borstie	
a retro cassette #39;rewind#39; noise effect	Hi, The title of the topic says it all. remember that ole re-wind or fast-forward noise-effect sound we get when doing the aforementioned in out cassette players. Just like this; I know its possible with digital audio but I dont know how feasible it is with Android, given Android devices sometimes limited processing power for such effects. Maybe such feature as this could be at users own risk but definitely would run fine on higher-specced devices. Could PA offer support for this fancy feature effect in future?		13 April 2011 - 04:34 PM	haddy	[This would be cool - especially with a jog wheel control (that springs back to neutral). You could then control the rate of tracking through the audio and in turn, the rate of rewind noise effect];[Yes a job wheel control, how awesome];[Updated Youtube vid link (....excuse the comedy of human impersonation in the vid, but you all get my jist of what the sound effect sounds like)];
artist albumssongs shuffle?	I love to be able to shuffle all songs for a particular artist from all of hishertheir albums. If I fancy a bit of Oasis id like to shuffle my complete collection of Oasis albums instead of shuffling through one of their albums and having to change album to get more. Is this possible? Artist pictures would be a nice touch too, similar to Player Pro. although the option to turn that off and not download the images should be added with it, incase users dont want to waste space on their sd card for the images which arent essential.		03 November 2011 - 12:54 PM	BagpussThe2nd	[This wasnt changed for PowerAMP 2.0: While playing album (or any other list), hit (or long press) shuffle icon for Shuffle list mode.

biggerhigher contrast track details in lock screenplayer	In the main player screen and lock screen the artist and album details are printed in a pale greyblue text using light strokes on a dark background, making it very hard to read on my HTC Desire (and, I suspect, many other small screen devices) in normal or filtered daylight. The song title is printed in larger, bold trext and is easier to read, but I would still prefer it to be either larger or higher contrast. Id like to be able to quickly check the artist or album at a glance, and thats just not possible for me right now. Id really like to see an option to change either the text or background colour, or perhaps choose a larger font or one with a heavier stroke weight.		13 October 2011 - 03:35 AM	huiac	[I agree, this is desperately needed. It is the only serious mark against Poweramp that I have. I find the artistalbum details virtually unreadable.

You wont believe though how many requests I got to restore color back like it was in PowerAMP 1.x. Though, Classic skin brings it back. Also, there are plans to bring more (downloadable) themes for PowerAMP 2.0, including at least 3 font color variations of standard themes.

album sorting after choosing a single song search result	Right now the current behavior after searching for a song title and selecting it is to either: a) Play the rest of the filtered search queue, or b) Continue playing the next song(s) in the quot;All songsquot; alphabetical list The behavior Id like is similar to (b), but Id like the player to have an option to continue in album order after the selected song is done (perhaps in the album sorting method thats been chosen for artist album pages, like alphabeticalyearetc.). Example scenario: Lets say I want to listen to quot;Taxmanquot; by The Beatles. What currently happens when I search for quot;Taxmanquot;: 1) quot;Taxmanquot; by The Beatles plays (track 1 on Revolver). 2) The next song alphabetically on my phone plays - which happens to be quot;Teddy Boyquot; by Paul McCartney, then quot;Teethquot; by Lady Gaga, etc. What Id like to happen when I search for quot;Taxmanquot;... 1) After the song finishes, the next song on the album plays - quot;Eleanor Rigbyquot; (track 2 on Revolver). 2) If I leave my phone running, the next Beatles album should play after Revolver... and then the next artist after The Beatles when thats all done. (This would be the exact behavior if I manually selected quot;Taxmanquot; on its album page). This shouldnt be too difficult to implement, I hope. It just makes a lot more sense to me than forcing the player to continue quot;all songsquot; alphabetically. Keep up the amazing work#33; Poweramp 2.0 is fantastic.		02 November 2011 - 01:54 AM	CapitalQ

a track indicator (please)	Hi,I would like to see this track indicator info.

The best place to display this IMO, on the already crammed UI, would be over the album art area using a standard small Android UI grey box (with mild transparency).

use volume control button for track selection	This is a near perfect music player for adroid tablets and phones and easily beats other competitors. Ive got one request to make our tablets and phones operate more like mp3 players: I wish we could have the option to use the volume up and down buttons for track forward and backward (e.g., when the screen turns off). That way, we dont have to turn on the screen and go to Poweramp to select a track.

default playlist	Hi! First of all, just say thanks to the dev team, because this is the best mp3 app Ive used so far. Ive been using the free version, and I have just upgraded to the paid one. I have two sugeestions (the second will be in another post, in order to keep them separated). Would it be possible to keep a "default playlist", like winamp, for example? I explain: right now, when you want to play files, you can play by folder, artist, genre, etc... but if you want to play some random files, you have to create a playlist, add files to that playlist, and later select "play playlist". It would be more usable if instead, you could do "add to current playlist", and then the selection would be added to the list of songs to play. This default playlist should be kept between shutdowns, and you could also export as a playlist. Forgive me if thos can be done in some way, but I have not been able to do it. Currently Im only using folder or artistalbum play, because its not very usable to saveload playlist every time you want to add songs. Anyway... its a GREAT program.

jump to album from a track in the #39;all#39; list	Hi, im using Poweramp for a couple of weeks now and i really love it. Ive replace my iPhone with a Samsung Galaxy S2 and im amazed about the difference in sound quality. Poweramp gives such a great and clear sound#33; Now there are only 2 small things i would really like to see in the Poweramp app and i would never even have to think about switching back. 1. when a track is playing, it would be really great if you could open the album it is on. For example, if im playing all my tracks on shuffle, sometimes i hear a track and it reminds me of the whole album or just one other track which is on that album. On the ipod you could just simply flip the album art cover over and see all the other tracks on that album. If you touched one of them it would start playing and would continue playing that album. Would a simulair function be possible on Poweramp? I would really like to see this. So much i would buy the app again tbh. 2. a search function in the player which is acceseble at all times.

multi select songsalbumsfolders for playlists	I like to create playlists by Genre. If I want to create an aLT playlist I need to go into either folders or artist and long-press on each one and add to playlist. If you added the function to enable multi-select I could check off all the ones I want, and click add to playlist once. This would speed things up tremendously and not make having to recreate my playlist such a chore.		28 April 2011 - 03:14 PM	Groan	[+1. Multi-select would be useful for many operations.];[+1 for multi select option when editing playlists. I often make subtle changes to my playlists on a daily basis based on my current mood at the time. This usually involves the removal of 1 or two mixesalbums. However, because i have to individually select each song from the mixesalbums in order to delete them, I end up just creating an entire new playlist which pretty much duplicates the previous one. It would be nice if i could simply go down the list and select the tracks i wish to remove and then click the drop-down arrow and select something such as quot;delete all selected files from playlist?quot; Im actually quite suprised that this is not already implemented. As mentioned above, it would be great if you could somehow do this vice versa as well in an advanced mode. e.g. Instead of going into one album, selecting a few songs, adding to the playlist and then backing out to go into another folderalbum for more songs. It would be nice if you could just multi-select throughout your folderslibrary, then select something like quot;add all selected files from folders to playlistquot;.

2 searching tweaks	Id like it if when you start typing from one of the library views, it starts searching in that view. So if I go to All Songs and start typing, it lists songs that match (and nothing else). Right now, you need to press the search key, then tweak the list to only show songs.Searches feel a little cluttered to me, because I almost always search by song title, then sometimes by artist. From the search view, theres a quot;list optionsquot; where I can disable everything but song title if I want. A better option (in my opinion) would be to reorder the options, so song titles show up first and then artist and then everything else. That way I dont have to either type more than necessary, or scroll down past any artists that might show up (given I have 700+ artists, its likely that therell be an artist hit when Im trying to search by title)Thanks#33; Otherwise, 2.0 is looking pretty good#33;		24 October 2011 - 01:10 AM	Quirken	[1.

ability to load audio-only of any video files (ffmpeg)	Hi,I have some FLV videos of rare groove music that I ripped from YouTube some time ago. These videos basically have just a still image of the artistband with the main audio track playing.This is an example of such a video; You see in no way am I requesting that Poweramp become a video player. NO. But Im just wanting if Poweramp could loaddecodeplayback the audio-only of video file by adding itself to the video file handler in Android.I should think that Poweramp uses that same FFMPEG source as apps like MoboPlayer and RockPlayer do meaning a great variety of audio and video formats are supported.btw, perhaps a prompt message (that could be disabled) could display to state something like "Poweramp does not support the playback of video. Never."		01 October 2011 - 10:02 AM	haddy	[So for this feature - all it requries is for Poweramp (when installed) to also be added to the list of video handlers quot;file-open asquot; under the Android system..

However I am unable to do the same with my .flv video files of mine (also ripped from Youtube) that have basic Mp3 audio inside that I want to play in Poweramp, simply because Poweramp cannot load any other file extensions apart from audio based ones. *Sadly and currently the quot;Recently playedquot; library list in Poweramp 2.0x does NOT display any recently played items that have been launched from a file manager app which is what I expected it to work when I launched the .mp4 video (audio only playback) with Es File Explorer Android#62;quot;open asquot; to launch in Poweramp. If this issue could also be addressed and looked at, thank you. *When I launched the .mp4 video (audio only playback) in Poweramp 2.0x. The audio plays and can pauseseek just fine as aforementioned before so no issues there. However there are some minor issues relating to swicthing between Library view and Player screen in that while playing this .mp4 I clicked on the song text area on the Player screen to take me to where it would be in the library songplaylist list (of course its not there) in where when I press return again to the Player screen, it either returns me to a different track in the Player or some wierd album art issue in where album art from one of my existing library tracks is assigned to this currently played .mp4 track in the Player screen. I think this issue in Poweramp 2.0x could be related in general to any File Manager quot;open asquot; playback of any standard supported audio files - although I have not tested this. Similar issue also when going into quot;Settingsquot; while playing back of an audiovideo luanched from a File Manager app. Apologies for the long sentence, please investiaget what possible bug.];[http:stackoverflow...file-on-android];
please give permission to drm files please	can you please give permission to listen to *.dcf files so we can listen to it? hello i am in love with the Poweramp app since it is the best music app in the world. with better user experience and better sound quality. the thing is the korean music sites give permissions for its users to listen to dcf files from samsung, lg or devices its partner with. so with the device you have let you listen to the dcf files, it allows you to listen with any app if the app gives permissions to open dcf. the music sites is the biggest music sites in korea with millions customers. the music app they give isnt good and you know Poweramp is better than samsung stock music app. a lot of people use playerpro instead of Poweramp because of this, even tough it is not as good. this is not illegal. this is legal and there will be no trouble. the drm is signed to the devices not what music app it is played to. please consider doing it. you will have so many more users from korea. thank you		23 October 2011 - 06:04 AM	chunjoe

dealbreaking features for me	So Ive been debating between Poweramp and other media apps. There are a few dealbreaking features, that would push me towards purchasing Poweramp, namely: 1) Text-box library search 2) Star ratings Now I know those two are said to be implemented in the update, and I can wait for them, but could someone tell me if the rest are already implemented, or included in the next updates? Or neither?! 3) Auto playlists (Recently played, Most played, Recently added etc) 4) Volume keys as nextprevious track (i.e. hold volume UP for next track, volume down for previous) 5) Jump to library from lock-screen widget when album art is clicked 6) Columns in "All Songs" list to arrange list by TitleArtists (like in your regular Winamp or Windows media player on the PC) Cheers!		15 March 2011 - 01:03 AM	DarXide	[Thanks for the feedbackrequests.1. You can press hardware Search button in any of PowerAMP lists (or long press menu button, if you have no hardware Search button), and just start typingto filtersearch a list.2, 3. planned - viewtopic.php?f=1t=1724. (stock) Android doesnt send volume key presses to background apps or when screen is off.This is possible on some non-stock ROMs, or via rooting the phone and using key remapping apps(for example, http:www.appbrain.... ... onremapper).5. not sure if it will be a jump, but 2 mode slider is planned, one of the sliding position will be go to PowerAMP.6. do you mean some dynamic sorting based on this fields?];[FYI. The long-press is required for Xoom. Unfortunately, it does nothing interesting here.

5 ideasrequests after the v2.0 beta	Post: Subject: Poweramp v2.0 Beta 1		01 October 2011 - 01:28 PM	haddy	[quot;1.)quot; Album art swipe to beginning track from last at the end of list seemed to have imporved a bit in the latest beta 3 since beta 1. Although the album art swipe to beginning track at end of list still feels a bit stuborn at times especially when the last track has no album art at all - its like the swipe functionPoweramp logo becomes temporarily disabled. So perhaps some investigation into an improvementbug fix would be great. quot;2.)quot; Well the show track counter feature is nevertheless optional as the developer, Max, intends it to be, so this is fine. quot;3.)quot; -Poweramp v2.0 Beta 2 addresses this issue and makes things better with the new optional ability to enable the Expand Menu option in Settings quot;4.)quot; Hmm... might have to make a newseparate topic for these Folders list related requests quot;5.)quot; -Poweramp v2.0 Beta 2 addresses this issue and makes things better with the new optional ability to enable the Expand Menu option in Settings];[Thanks for your input haddy#33; Soon after 2.0 release I will start planning the next one, and Im already collecting the suggestionsrequests for 2.1. Re: album art animation lower fps during fast track changes. This is more visible on 1 core and low end phones, than on 2 cores, this is due to the fact that PowerAMP prioritizes audio engine at such moments to avoid gap between tracks. Actually, when track is changed, 2 files are played for short time + search for next cover arts is happening, and the later is given lower priority. Also, loading the texture into GPU (which happens when new album art is found) can lower fps for a short time as well. PowerAMP dynamically loadsunloads album art textures as number of such images is usually high and you can keep only a few in GPU memory.];
add #34;starting screen#34; option	Hello, Im currently using 1.4 full - I still have features to discover, probably and I havent try 2.0 beta yet - but I would like to know if it will be possible to add some options to the quot;start screenquot; in V2. Currently my start screen is: (v1.4 full screen) Will it be possible is it already possible in V2 (beta) ? Thanks in advance for your answers.		17 October 2011 - 09:42 AM	CptDobey	[Yes this is what I tried to do with Poweramp v2.0 beta 3 and it doesnt work... ..I went into the Library and I changed the list view of Albums to quot;gridquot; and then went into Settings and set the startup screen to quot;libraryquot; and then started up Poweramp again and it just starts from the main Library view. So the startup screen option in the Settings simply needs the enhancement to be able to do this. What a great idea CptDobey, well done.];
pulse visualizations	I do really like visualizations on music players, and I was really looking forward to see when it will be out. In your changelog visualizations is listed, and this is fantastic news for me, but could you also create a visual setting to make the light behind the album cover to pulse with the music? That would be really nice! Thanks!		15 June 2011 - 07:32 PM	Behnam	[I would love this too];[Max, If you are still interested in adding Visualizations to Poweramp, despite some limited cpu and battery on some Android devices, .....then you might be interested in this open-souce library called projectMhttp:projectm.sourceforge.net ..check it out#33;];
extended tags: #39;publisher#39; #39;composer#39; #39;copyright#39; etc	I requested this feature to Max in an email and he already stated that this is planned (in some way) for Poweramp.Basically I requested if Poweramps Info window would add, as permanent tag fields, some extended tags namely just the following first:-Publisher - shows record label, company or organization, was added to id3 v2 spec, also used in wma tags, flacogg and aac tags-Composer - who wrote the original song, even HTC sense music player supports this tag-Copyright - legal creators of the tracksong-Disc Number - of course for tracks on double-disc albums, even HTC sense music player supports this tag tooThere are many other extended tags that exist and that users, unassumingly, would discover in their tracks. For the many more extended tags Poweramps Info window could either display them all if in the track(s) (downwards scroll) or otherwise incoroporate a tabbed interface within the window to display the rest.You see above, I recommend any Windows users to try and play with a freeware app called mp3tag (www.mp3tag.deen) for which you can customize mp3tags interface to always display and edit these tags (I dont work for mp3tag Im just a fanboy).I also suggested that the Info window should be scrollable and thats scrollable downwards not sideways so that long text remains word-wrapped sideways within the size of the Info window.Many online purchase-music stores tag their tracks with these information and its lovely to have a player that can display this information.		29 November 2010 - 09:35 AM	haddy	[Thanks for the request. Support for more tags in tag viewer is planned (not sure about tag editing them, as its going to be monster form then).];[I second that request. Tags such as composer etc. are great to have, especially if you like classical music.];[Also Max,In addition to this request:1. Please add customizable tag fields - as in instead of this COMPOSER=Composer user could completely change the tag field display name to something wacky like this COMPOSER=COmPyzz so the latter example of "COmPyzz" would display as the tag field name as the Composer entry. Both foobar2000 and mp3tag support this same tag-field-display custom naming (first mp3tag screenshot above) .2. Additionally the ability to reorder the tag fields in the Info window (e.g. which tag field displays at the top first) just like how foobar2000 can do this (in foobar2000s Preferencesadvanceddisplayproperties dialogstandard fields), see this topic on foobars forum for what I mean. Not an important feature but still a feature to consider for future. May require Info window to have its own settings space to do this.];[Max, In a message elsewhere you said that you would try to integrate this feature for 2.0 as an expandable area Can you confirm any further announcements on this and whether it would make the TODO; viewtopic.php?f=1t=172];[Done. Thanks!];[Thanks for that TODO update on this. I greatly await 2.0];[Related to this: tracks from multi-disc albums arent always played in the correct order. For users with lots of live music collections (e.g. eTree) this is an issue.];[Hey Max Can I just ask, to make sure about this, whether Ill be able to use these extra tags to filter and search the library view? For me this is the only thing missing in this player. Ive always used the composer fields to keep together albums with lots of different artists (such as mix albums mixed by a particular DJ, a g). It would be great to be able to choose to add composer alongside artist, album and the other library sort fields, as you can in Sense and iOS. Thanks again! Peace];[Maybe an additional option to disable the expandable method that is planned and just have all found tags in one scrollable window - this would be a secondary option];[I really really wished that this would make the v2.0 release of Poweramp...ah well, at least this request for extended tags is still planned in an incremental 2.xx update according to Max himself.];
please update the design of the notification icon	..Well at least the white triangle could be colored in as blue to match the glow blue playpause icon in the main PA interface.This is the smallest request I have made so far thank you.		10 June 2011 - 08:45 PM	haddy	[hehe. id love a selection of icons as well. best i have seen so far is google musics. love those headphones... would love for it to change according to the theme you choose or give it the same play button icon you see your music files get when Poweramp is set to default.];[I would really love to see the blue Poweramp thunder-bolt on top of that same round button -as a better more stand-out notification icon.];
edit multiple tags at once	Thought it might be a good idea to be able to multiselect items in, say, an album and change the album name all at once instead of doing it one at a time.

only play 4 #38; 5 star music as well as any unrated music	I have not seen this on any other player but it would be great to have a category, like beta 2 has most played rated etc, but only plays 4 amp; 5 star and unreated music. The reason I feel for including unrated music, along with 4 and 5 star music, is that everything will be played under this category until you choose not to like it. With players like media center is that if you choose your favourites then only the high star music gets played and any new music in the last 30 days. But if you have a large music collection then there is a chance you may not hear some of your new music within that 30 days and then the new music drops of the favourites category. The way I got around that is I open up media player and find all unrated music and make them 5 stars. That way they are still kept as a favourite for infinite time unless I choose they are not worthy of 5 stars But with 4 amp; 5 star music WITH UNRATED music then everything will be in the favourtites category until you actually choose you dont want to listen to it as a favourite.		21 October 2011 - 05:18 AM	pbrown77	
future android devices with cddvd players (maybe)	Hi, Think about it, If FFMPEG (which Poweramp uses) already supports CD-DA audio on Windowsall platforms and if there is probable FFMPEG library support for other quot;Discquot; audio formats on these Android OS hardwares like DVD audio then it might be good to make sure that Poweramp app supports proper playing back and handling of these files. Thik about Google TV and its Android app support.... Plus Google TVAndroid integrated into Blu Ray players like the Sony NSZ-GT1 Just a thought...		20 October 2011 - 11:16 PM	haddy	
minimise everything but album art option	Loving the look of version 2 and got be thinking it would be nice to have the option to have the track info area down the bottom to be transparent or minimise itself like the shuffle etc does.

options for themes and colors	From using Poweramp for over a year now all I can say is that it needs more themes. I know pre-installed themes are scarce, but heres a few suggestions: * Allow users to create their own theme with quot;red, green and bluequot; presets and adjust the settings accordingly. * Release how you made the previous themes to users and allow them to make their own themes like keyboard themes on the market.		20 October 2011 - 10:11 AM	nklenchik	
mono bottleneck #38; shelf controls	Long time user of Poweramp and have used it as my main player for a while, Just been dying to hear the other half of my music at work XD, just asking for a mono bottleneck to headphones so I can work safely XD.

queue improvements from 2.0 beta	Hey all, Have been rocking the 2.0beta for the last day or so and love what I see - two niggly things with the queue keep coming to mind: - Dont add duplicate tracks - would be nice if there was a menu option, or a setting to prevent duplicates from being queued. If a songs already queued up, dont add it again unless I want it added again ( handy for when adding playlists to the queue ) - Automatically remove a track from the queue once listened to. The queue seems to track the played tracks by marking them greydark, but would also be nice to maybe (setting?) remove a track from the queue once played. Mark		10 October 2011 - 11:27 AM	talios	[Thanks for the feedbackrequest. 1. will think about adding this option for queue as well. 2. queue behaves a bit differently. It will clean up itself if ALL songs were played from it. Otherwise, new songs will be added to the end of the queue. This allows adding the played queue items to the playlists. Queue always jumps to first non-played item if return to queue option is enabled.];

control player via volume buttons	Dear Maxim Petrov, First of all thank you for the great work your doing! I really like Poweramp, but I also tested several other music players aswell. I think none of them features such a great audio quality as Poweramp does. This is the main reason why I decided for Poweramp. I nearly finished the 15-days-trial-version and now I consider buying Poweramp. But one feature I really miss is to skip tracks forward or backward via the volume buttons of my android device. This is a feature that my old SE Walkman phone had and that is also provided by several other music players for android devices like e.g. Winamp or PlayerPro. I think this is one essential feature to be implemented and I read in some forums that many users would like to see this being provided by Poweramp. Is it possible for you to implement this feature soon? Or do you even already plan to provide this feature with the coming update to version 2.0 this summer? Id really appreciate a positive answer from you Greetings martinxy		27 June 2011 - 01:58 PM	martinxy	[Thanks for the feedbackrequest. Have you actually tried the PlayerPro volume keys for track changes? Have you noticed how they work? This is because non-rootedstock Android doesnt send key presses to apps when they are on background orand in screen-off state. Thus, app should set lock screen to always ON for any key press. This way app will be able to receive the key UP event (key DOWN is not received by player as the screen is off when its pressed). This basically makes this function only a feature line, but not usable on most of the phones. I have many test devices, and Player Pro doesnt work reliable on any of them. This is why its not implemented this way in PowerAMP. WinAmp for Android doesnt have such feature at all. Note that rooted or non-stock Android ROM is able to remap the long press on volume rocker to appropriate media key events - this way they are handled by any music player, including PowerAMP (via apps like Remapper). This way it really works, but requires root (or non stock rom).];[Thanks for your answer! I didnt know about such limitations. I did some hours of research via google and looked through several forums to get information about skipping tracks via volume control before posting this topic. But I barely found useful information cocncerning this issue. Now, at least I know that its not possible wihtout a root. Ahh... and no, I didnt actually try the other players myself. I prefer to gather information about software Id like to purchase first and do not like downloading anything without knowing it is a quality product. I wanted to stick with and will stick with Poweramp, because it provide better audio optimization features I think and also because it has a cool name ... I mean come on "PlayerPro" is such a boring name that the people developing this cant really be that talented. If Id decide to develop a product, Id make finding a good and creative name high priority. To sum this up... I just submitted this because I thougt what they can you should be able to do with ease, but I didnt know this function was so limited by stock android versions. Greetings martinxy PS: Damnit... just now I did another search and also found some topics in the Poweramp forums about this feature... Im sorry for having wasted ur time - but I like how you are so patient replying to those questions u already answered anyway...];[hi, is there any chance that you will be able to have this as an option with a warning that its only for root users ? i use Poweramp on my phone when im driving and its a major pain (not to mention dangerous !) to unlock the screen then find the skip button ... thanks !];[guys, I used to have Poweramp installed in my cell phone with CyanogenMod and the volume rocker would work fine to change tracks I am now using a different ROM (still rooted) but volume rocker no longer works with that purpose any suggestions?];
playlist shuffle setting	I would really like to configure my playlist to set the shuffle setting when selected. For some playlists I like to play in order for others I prefer random. For example I like to have MovieBroadway lists play in order since they usually tell a story. Pink Floyd - The Wall comes to mind. I like my workout playlist to always play random. I also dont like the fact that if I have "shuffle all" set and then I select a playlist from a folder it doesnt play songs from the list but reverts back to the shuffle all after playing one playlist song. I always forget to change my setting to "shuffle folder" before I select my playlist folder and then I dont know why the wrong songs are playing. Drives me crazy.		23 June 2011 - 11:33 PM	desperado	[I agree totally with this request#33; I have nothing more to add that my support of this idea];
next song with volume keys	Hi, i love Poweramp, i think it has almost all features needed for a good mobile music player. The only thing i would love is to be able to skip a song without using the screen .. I mean im mostly using my Galaxy Tab as a media player with screen off and when i want to skip a song i need to enable the screen and use the next button. Maybe it could be possible to skip a song with a behaviour .. : double clic on volume button or long press on volume button .. if its possible to have that as an option it would be great Thanks		14 October 2011 - 08:42 AM	fredv

upgrade equalizer to parametic or increase bands?	Well theres barely anything else Poweramp can do to become an even better player it is now which is perfect. So why not please improve the equalizer? Im a big user of equalizer. As an audiophile I always tune my outputs sound to my preferred sound signature or to remove sibilance as much as possible. I could do so much more if Poweramp had more bands in their equalizer (like 20) or even changed it to a parametic equalizer (example electri q parametic equalizer) with unlimited equalizing potential. Thanks!		16 April 2011 - 11:09 PM	bisayaboi	[Thanks for the request. More bands are possible (for high-end devices), I will consider options for this. As for parametric equ, it wont generally work for PowerAMP, as its will be very easy to get over some calculated limits and get unexpected results. In fact, PowerAMP equ dsp is a parametric equalizer, but with fine tuned frequencies, q and other coefficients.];[That ll be an massive improvement..];[just wanted to chime in on this topic. more frequencies would be VERY awesome. the nine so far are far and away better then any of the other players i tried but if more are possible then i would love to see it.];[We have 10 bands. Nice. 20 would be awesome!];[Max mentioned that a parametric equilizer is used internally but hes not too interested in developing user interface. If youre rooted and open Poweramps SQLite database with SQLite Editor, for example, theres eqpresets table in folders.db. Entries looks like this: 31=0.39;62=0.213;125=0.086;250=-0.199;500=-0.15;1K=0.15;2K=0.24;4K=0.39;8K=0.39;16K=0.39;preamp=.71 Anyone brave to edit an entry to see if the preset would work after that? Potentially, one could develop an app to work with the database directly.];[Bump! I think a parametric equalizer is a fantastic option. There could be an option to choose either the standard 10 Band Equalizer or the Parametric Equalizer.];[One way to really take this feature and go nuts with it would be to make the 10 and 20 band EQ be accessible also via a widget with an option to allow its audio effects to work across all multimedia output, even pandora and spotify etc. As far as Ive seen there are no 10band EQs that can do this, let alone 20 band.];
album artist support	Hello! Let me firstly say that i am very impressed about this app. As a foobar2000 user i am very happy to have found this technically great player for my new android phone. Great work! The only bad experience i have with Poweramp is that albums with different artists are cluttered in the artist view in library. So i would like to ask for album artist support. I think there are two possibilities to realize that support: a simple solution and a more enhanced one. The first one would just try to recognize if an album contains multiple artists and would group it then under "Various artists". Probably that would be a good solution for many users but for another part of the userbase that would mean that they will loose information saved to file. In many players for pc you can store the content for album artist. As all the players (Itunes, winamp, wmp, foobar2000, Helium music manager, Jriver MC, Media Monkey) go different ways it may be a bit tricky to satisfy all needs. I made some thoughts how the advanced support of album artist could look like and i think that three options could cover all possibilities: 1. "Use Itunescompilation flag". That is the option for our friends who use itunes. If that option is checked and there is no other album artist tag inside the file this flag is used to group different artist under one album. 2. Many player use an frame which is not predefined. In regard to how VorbisApe tags and ID3v2-TXXX (header) frames are written the frameheader name consists of natural language. I think it would be sufficient if Poweramp would use by default "album artist; albumartist" exactly in that order. I cant imagine that there are many people who would like to add a further name but who knows? 3. In regard to MP3s there is the defacto standard (WMP, itunes, Media monkey) that album artist is mapped to the TPE2 frame. An option for this mapping seems senseful as on one side this became a defacto standard but on the other side some player prefer the TXXX frame. (As i dont have wma or mp4 files i dont know how their frames for album artist is called but they must have one) Thanks for reading! I hope that you will adress the issue anyway! Many regards!		15 May 2011 - 01:26 PM	stankovic	[Hi, thanks for the feedbackrequest. PowerAMP displays Library entries as is - as they are scanned by system android media scanner.

some bugs and feature reqs majorly about embedded cue	Great!I cant stop to try the 430. So I installed it and tried at once.I think I dont need to say how good it is, go to try it yourself. Ill just report some bugs and have some feature requests here.The main menu (when you press menu button)s position can be wrong while putting status bar to the bottom (using CM7, etc.), this is a bug since 1.4I use monolithic flac to handle all things (cue, rg, art, etc.) and it works fine (but it seems Poweramp cannot handle front cover image 1MB?) except embedded cue.The cue-in-flac support in 2.0 is great, but I think something can be improved and tweaked:1. It seems that if the flac has an embedded cue, Poweramp cannot read album arts from it.2. Maybe expand the flac-cue file in which folder contains it (make the tracks in it the same level with other separated files, not treat it as a virtual folder ) can be more easy to understand and organize the playing list.3. I know its hard to delete some track from a cue-separated flac file, but modifying cue in it can be easy using libflac. Or maybe just add a feature called "hide" and handles which tracks should be play and which not by Poweramp itself.Thanks maxmpz, this one is really really great, and lets do together to improve it!		01 October 2011 - 01:50 PM	tyeken8	
keep poweramp lock screen, even when no music	It would be handy for the Poweramp lockscreen to permanently replace the normal lock screen, even when no music is playing. Its a nice lock screen		02 August 2011 - 08:19 AM	Gibbz	[Or to tie it on the mode. like when i am in silent mode, then the normal lock screen should engage, when on airplane then the po0weramp lock screen engages.];
deleting music	Just a quick one... I think it would be better if when we delete an album, the folder should be deleted too. For example; I go into Metallica, I long press on the album Master of Puppets, then all the songs AND the folder that I aptly have named "Master of Puppets" ought to be deleted. Currently it only deletes the content of that folder.		29 August 2011 - 12:26 PM	griff	[what if i got a folder metallica and some songs of master of puppets, but also from other metallica albums?];

folder button, go to last used folder	It would be nice if the folder button could be changed or at least configured to bring the user back to the last used folder whenever the button is used from outside the folder view, while always bringing the user back to the defined root folder if clicked from inside the folder view. There are various situations, where the lack of this option is pretty annoying, e.g.:1. Open player2. Go to folder view, navigate to some subfolder x below your root folder3. Enqueue a couple of songs while remaining in folder view4. Hit the Library button to go to the library5. Go to queue6. Start first song while remaining in queue list7. Decide to add another track from the folder view8. Try to get back to subfolder x.The back button doesnt help in this case; neither does the folder button, which brings you back to the root folder.If the folder button would work in the suggested way, in step 8 you would just click it once to get back to the previously used folder and twice if you wanted to get back to the root folder. That would be much more comfortable than the current approach!Edit: I have suggested something similar before, but this new suggestion is a bit different, so I hope its not viewed as repostspam.		05 March 2011 - 04:45 PM	ohnoanotheraccount	[By far the biggest issue I have with the back button is that in the player it returns you to the homescreen intstead of the library. This is very annoying and counter intuitive in my opinion. The home button already does the same thing! Could you implement options to control the back button behavior or at least make it not return you to the homescreen and to the library or wherever you last where instead. Thank you!];[PowerAMP main "back to library" buttons is mini-display on main screen. Short press goes to current played list (i.e. folder, if you play from folder), and long press goes to parent list of current played list. In PowerAMP, back button works in standard android way - it returns your to previous activity (screen). It shouldnt and cant open library activity for you, if previous activity was a home screen, but you can configure PowerAMP to start from Library or folders or last played list - this can be more appropriate to you - just try. Thanks!];[Thank you for the quick response. The back button returns me to the last screen in all other cases except in the player. For example if I choose a song from the library it opens the player and starts playing like it should, however if I then pres back it goes to the home screen and not the library where I last was. This is the issue for me. It should return back to the library but instead it goes to the home screen.];[Why do I have an impression that in earlier versions of Poweramp there was an option in the settings for the Back button to go to the home screen? I may be thinking of a different app. In any case, darktwinkle, what you experience is not right Poweramp behavior. I would uninstall it and re-install again.];[I was having the same problem as dartwinkle but solved it by going into:SettingsStartup ScreenChoose Last played FolderLibrary list option.];[Thanks for the advice, hopefully it works! Update: Reinstalling didnt work but erased all my settings so I restored my old version using titanium backup. After installing backup, the back button actually worked as it should for a while.I think this is because I had the start screen set to library. I dont understand what the point of setting the start screen is, whenever I start Poweramp it goes to the player and shows the last song that was playing. Even if I stop the service using a task killer. So it never actually starts to the start screen. I think this may be the root of the back button problem. Is there a way to exit Poweramp so that the next time its started it goes to the set start screen and not the player (other than restoring app+data using titanium)?];[Is it possible that your settings get messed up because of killing the service?];[Id like to get back to the original topic, which is the folder button. The back button is not my concern.My suggestion was: whenever the folder button is used from outside the folder list bring the user back to the last used folder. If it is clicked from inside the folder list, go to the root folder (as is now always the case when you click the folder button).I believe this would add extra value to the folder button without confusing users.Why shouldnt there be an additional shorter way to get there?If you are in the queue list and want to get back to the most recently used folder, my solution would require one click on the folder button, and if you wanted to get to the root folder from the queue list, two subsequent clicks in the same spot would be needed. An intuitive and quick solution.Your approach requires one click to get to the root folder, but two clicks in different spots (player button and mini-display) to get to the most recently used folder. Also to get to the most recently used folder the user needs to click "player" first, when he actually wants to get to a folder and has a folder button in view. Thats not intuitive at all.];[Any thoughts on this? Any chance the suggested option for the folder button will be implemented?];[*bump*];
notification cntrl, widget show playlist, playlist shortcuts	Poweramp is a great music player, there are however three main features i would really like to see before upgrading to paid version. Control from notification bar: Basically same controls as the 4x1 widget in the notification drop down so music can be changed without having to open player or go to home screen widget. Show playlist on widget: With the 4x1 player widget it would be great to flash the playlist name instead of songalbum for 0.5 - 1 second when you cycle using the and buttons so i can quickly see which playlist im switching to. Playlist shortcuts: It would be good to be able to put a shortcut to a playlist on the home screen, to quickly start playing my favourite playlists without having to go into the player. Implementing the suggestion above for showing playlist name on widget would be a good interim solution. Keep up the good work, you have a great effort here which is well on its way to being the best player on the market.		31 July 2011 - 10:12 PM	aza9999	[Thanks for the request. Generally this is possible only for Androids 3.0+. For 2.x, the notification panel closes itself on anything clicked inside apps notification block. This makes buttons like unusable there.];[Thats a shame then, what about the next two items? Flashing the playlist name briefly on the homescreen widget (i use the 4x1) when switching between playlists using the buttons would be very handy for me, and the ability to add a playlist shortcut to the homescreen (winamp can do this) would also be great.];[I would greatly appreciate it if you can implement the controls previous and next track into the notification bar as i am running a honeycomb tablet. I find it is the only thing missing in this player. Im purchasing this right after the trial period. I hope you could add the controls feature soon. Or atleast make it an option to toggle the display of the control arrows in the settings menu. Thanks for the great work your team has done on this player so far. Greatly appreciated.];[could you make it an option to toggle on off for us tablet users. I find it is the only feature missing in this player];[I would like to second this request. 95 of the time I listen to music via various playlists.

hide shuffle amp; repeat buttons	I think that a nice improvement to Poweramp would be to include an option in the menu to hide the Shuffle Repeat buttons as I keep setting them to ShuffleRepeat the current album, but then end up accidently pressing one of them and not noticing until a random song starts to play.

a minimalistic widget request	Hello I think that the option to disable the background in widgets is already a step in the good direction. However, on lighter backgrounds, the blue text with shadows is hard to read and doesnt look very well. Id request a widget that simply displays its text in black, without any shadows etc. It would be perfect if the text color could be user-defined, but a simple blackwhite selection would be a good start. Take care and keep up the good work edit: I have found Phantom Music Control on the market - it is precisely what I described in this thread So if anyone wants to have a nice and minimal widget for Poweramp, look it up.		20 August 2011 - 03:27 PM	peterabelard	
resume on headset-connect problem	The feature is very useful but it should be possible that it only resumes if the music was actually playing when I disconnected the headset. Example: 1) Music plays - Headset is removed - Music pauses - Headset reconnected - Music resumes 2) Music isnt playing but I watch a video - Headset is removed - Headset reconnected - Music starts playing In the second case the music shouldnt start playing, I think. Only in case one. Maybe that can be implemented? Thanks.		19 August 2011 - 10:13 AM	bur	[This change would be bad for me, but I have a compromise: what if implementing this change as an option: user should decide (somewhere in Settings) if in the second case music should or shouldnt start playing when headset connected.];
simple lockscreen widget request...	I would love to see a simple lockscreen widget that has a transparent (blank) background and nothing more than small versions of the play#092;pause, previous song, next song buttons without the album art, song information, etc. Also would love for it to be placed right on the lockscreen without having to tap a button to bring up the lockscreen to unlock the phone. I got the idea from a ROM for my Incredible called Evervolv that when you use the Google Music player, it adds a widget with just the play#092;pause, previous song, next song buttons to the bottom of the lockscreen under the swipe bars. Its really subtle looking and doesnt clutter up the lockscreen. Just an idea...		17 August 2011 - 01:19 AM	flyinjoe13	
correction on cue#39;s	Hi Lately Ive experienced that Poweramp is not reading the cue files correct. Or thats at least what I think. When I listen to an album and I then skip a track, the track starts a few seconds after it was supposed to be (I know exactly where they should start, since I also use cue files on my PC). Is this something you can take a look at? It has happened for both mp3 and m4a (bought on iTunes Store). Ive got a Samsung Galaxy S II, running Gingerbread 2.3.3. Thanks!		22 July 2011 - 02:20 PM	chreddy	[Alright, over the last couple of days Ive figured something out. There seems to be no problems for music bought on iTunes Store (m4a files), but when it comes to mp3 this problem occurs everytime. Ive noticed on a couple of albums that the last included tracks are starting about 20-30 seconds after the cue file says it should. In other words, if it should start at 68:00:00, its probably starting at about 68:25:00 instead. This was just an example to show what I mean. Since I opened this thread, Ive rooted my phone and flashed Cyanogenmod 7, so it seems like its not some problem with Samsungs standard ROMs (Just to exclude this possibility).];
android notifications causing pause	Id like to quote MitchInOmaha, whos asked the following:I guess it was placed on the wrong end in this forum because there hasnt been any reply to it yet.

Turning this option off would let the nav-voice be incomprehensible when playing music with sung lyrics. But with the option on, it makes the music pause too with every incoming e-mail, sms, etc. So I guess what Im looking for is an option to take apart the switches for notifications and for navigation, if possible, of course.];

For example, email attachment requires "Read email attachment" permission.There are no video players currently for android which allow plugging the other players like this, also this is technically almost impossible (due to the video-audio sync which should be withing milliseconds).Estranged 1. try to raise PowerAMP headset priority in PowerAMP Headset settings2. try to disable headset support in other 3rd party players (yes, they can affect headset functionality this way).];[For email attachment see viewtopic.php?f=1t=813p=11489hilit=email#p11489];

bluetooth headphones	Hi there,Id just like to make a request for a settings menu for bluetooth headphones. I have a pair of Sony DR-BT50 headphones which have a few controls on the left ear, heres a pic:At the moment,[folder +] and [folder -] = do nothing,[depressing the rocker] = playpause,[quick tap up on the rocker] = next song,[quick tap down on the rocker] = previous song,[long hold up on the rocker] = next album,[long hold down on the rocker] = previous album,and [volume updown] = just that.I would love to be able to customise this so that holding the rocker would skim through the current song, and the folder controls would flick through albums. I understand that there are a lot of different bluetooth headphones out there, and thats why a settings menu would be sweet! Thanks for considering the idea Poweramp people, I love the product already, this would just make it the shiz.Cheers		22 July 2011 - 06:49 AM	Aidos107	[Thanks for the request.

Would be a nice little detail. This is my first post. =)];
why you need an exit button	First, let me say that Ive been loving this app since the day I downloaded it. It may not be the prettiest, but the ability to customize it is simply unrivaled. I also love how it can pauseresume based on the headphone jacks state. ...This is also its undoing without an exit button. You know, one to completely kill the app. You see, I also use internet radio, specifically grooveshark and spotify, and I also love their android apps. Now, if I was using PoweAMP at any point since boot and had simply paused my music, when I go to plugin the headphones to listen to GroovesharkSpotify, Poweramp...resumes playback. I dont always want to stop the track, and sometimes I pause it, and by the time I come back forget I had a track playing before. This makes it really, really hard to use Poweramp without an exit button.		27 July 2011 - 04:14 AM	Glassweaver	[You can exit PowerAMP with back button. Other components (like services) can be started and killed by system. Also, in Android app process is not an app managed component at all. viewtopic.php?f=1t=810p=3115#p3115 Thanks!];[You can essentially minimize Poweramp with the back button, but the background services that power it, including the monitoring of the headphone jack, are still active. Other (streaming) music services offer this same convenience, but if I havent completely *stopped* the song in Poweramp, Poweramp will obviously resume playback...and so will the other application. Hmm...I see your point now, but I hope you also see my dilemma with the fact that sometimes, a user might not always press stop (like me, indenting to come back and listen more later) but then they go to, say, Slacker Radio for a while, and when they plug in the headphones, the programs compete for the headphones...then I go stop Poweramp and restart my song on Slacker. Minor inconvenience, but still frustrating. I have no idea how hard this would be (Im C++ Java, with no Android experience), but if you get enough people who ask about this, maybe writing in something where the resume on headphone jack feature will stop monitoring the jack after a set time, or stop itself if it senses another audio programs launch? Anyway, I still love your app. Just trying to think of ways to make it better =)];

return to last folder library category accessed	Hi, Love this player, love it!!! But the only thing thats a little annoying is sometimes I like to listen to random music depending on my mood.. ie I might like to listen to songs from same artist so I will play one song then go back to library and pick another.. So what would be really cool is when you hit the folder library button it could return you to the last accessed folder or (artistalbum etc) category that you were previously in. As at the moment I have to press the folderlibrary button, then change it to library mode and then go through all the menus again to get to the same place. Also would be cool if there was a quicker way to access the library and playlists from the player screen instead of having to hit the button then library then playlists etc.. other than that, perfect!

per headset type volume	In this thread: http:powerampapp.c...to volume#p1931 a per headset type (headphones bluetooth solo) volume setting was suggested, and it was stated that this might be part of a future release.Is it still planned? At the volume I listen to with headphones, music is nearly inaudible over BT in my car, and once I realize why theres no sound, it can be tricky to safely change the volume. Also, as the action of the volume buttons on my Desire dont affect audio until something is playing, I have to make sure that Im not wearing headphones when I plug them in. Combined, it makes the v. useful auto start feature less usable.Cheers,Simon.		28 July 2011 - 12:38 PM	Simian60	
state of the following feature requests?	The two following feature requests have been on the board for quite some time now; if I can remember correctly, probably since beta. Whats their current state and when can we expect them to be incorporated? "Listen To" support using Google Voice Search. I talked to Google directly on this one and they say it needs to be implemented by you, not them. There is a small line of code that needs to be added to each app that wants "Listen to" support. Apparently, its not that difficult to add according to Google. If added, users can hit the voice search button on their device and say "Listen to... [Artist, Song, Playlist, etc]" and it will launch a window with suggestions, then open up in Poweramp. Again, a small bit of code written by Google is required to be added to whatever app [in this case Poweramp] before it can take advantage of this feature. Visualizations This one is going to be more then a line or two of code, bug again, its been on the list for a long time. I really dont want to see it half-aed which is why I have not follow up on it when I asked months ago. It would be really nice to see this added, especially since a lot of phones can output to HDMI. At this point, I am kind of worried this feature request will turn out like the visualizations in iTunes, which are total crap. I remember using winamp 12 years ago in college and seeing some amazing visualizations plugins, that kind of quality would be nice. Hell, if you dont have the time to designed visualizations, can you make them plugin based and allow 3rd party people to make them? Thanks for the info.		26 July 2011 - 12:27 AM	Thalinor	[It looks like visualizations have been deferred to 2.1 - viewtopic.php?f=3t=172 Definitely wouldnt mind seeing the voice search, though.];
crossfade suggestion	Hello. Im using Poweramp on my phone and Im very happy with it I have a suggestion about the crossfade function that Im sure is simple to implement and will make Poweramp the life of the party or atleast a radiostation that plays everything you want in your pocket The current (traditional) crossfade is to lower the volume of the track that ends, untill it reaches zero (fade-out), and, at the same time, raise the volume of the track that just starts from zero to the maxx (fade-in). While this feature is great and very useful, you could also add as additional (user-selectable) option for a crossfade WITHOUT fade-in and fade-out, just play the next track over the last track, when the fade time, selected by the user is reached. This will create the nice effect for DJ-like application that never stops playing, and, I think most users will like it. If no one has an idea what Im talking about, hear the next example:http:www.mediafire...u2nuxp2je5sa1iuNote the crossfade, between the songs, the next song plays without fade in over the current one, and the current one has no fade-out.		23 July 2011 - 12:00 PM	m3gab0y	
archos 5	I am looking for a better music player for my Archos 5, and picked-up an interesting review of your app. I need some information please from you I do not use the Archos as a phone, so I will not be able to download directly. Can I do so via my PC? I use the Archos as a media player through my high-end Hi-Fi. I do not download MP3s, all of my music files are full-format Windows Media Files ripped from my own CDs to retain full frequency-spread. All of these are synched regularly via my PC, together with playlists that I compile on the PC. Does your app sync with Windows Media Player? If answers to both the above are yes, are there any known issues regarding yor player and my methodology that I should be made aware of before purchasing? In answering that, please do not try and persuade me that what I am doing is not ideal - it works for me, I am quite happy with it, its just that the media player loaded on the Archos when I purchased it is not particulary good, and I wish to upgrade it.

automatic ratings	Would it be possible to count the number of plays a song gets and if it is played more than 13 through to increase rating or play count? If Im in my car and a song comes around that I am not in the mood for, Ill skip to the next song. If I like the song, Ill listen all the way through. Over time this would help me rank my songs and know which I can remove. For example if I rip a new CD with 10 songs and only 3 are good, I can use my mp3tag editor on the PC to sort by my rating (or number of complete plays) to decide which songs can be deleted from my SD card to free up space.

caching of embedded album art	The caching mechanism doesnt seem to process embedded album art. I have a few albums in which the mp3s contain relatively very large (640kb) embedded album art. Whenever a song of one of these albums is played, the player only responds to next or other commands after it is done loading and resizing the embedded image (which sometimes takes several seconds). I could, of course, reduce the sizes of the embedded images, but Im lazy :-) Also, perhaps a more compelling reason: it seems more efficient to use the (effective) caching mechanism for embedded album art instead of using cpu cycles for resizing the image every time a song with embedded art is played.		04 July 2011 - 11:52 PM	dinfinity	[Thanks for the report. Caching works only for downloaded album art, embed album art is always extracted. Though, 640kb album art shouldnt take more than 100ms to decode (which is slow of course, but this is phone, not pc). PowerAMP uses special algorithm which ensures the decoded image wont be larger thant 1000x1000px (even if its originally larger than that), so the top time should be constant. "Several seconds" is somewhat unusual. It can be something with the image format as well. PowerAMP album art resolverdownloader is currently runs in the separate thread and album art download requests are serialized, though, it wont affect the playback functionality - this runs in isolated specific threads independently of other parts. Please send that (one) track to poweramp.maxmpz gmail.com for some tests. PowerAMP v2.0 now processes multiple album art images (up to 5) in advance and I want to be sure that all types of embed art is processed fast. Also, what is your phone modelAndroid os version?];[Phone is (Dutch) HTC Desire Z (Virtuous 1.0.1 Custom ROM (Android 2.2.1) (and many more customizations). Side note: the tracks (with large embedded album art) do start playing, its just that most controls are dysfunctional while the image is decoded. Sample track will be emailed asap!];

feature request: smart shuffle	Hi, Love Poweramp and have used it exclusively since day 2 of owning my Samsung Galaxay i9000. So much better than the stock player and others available on the android market. I almost exclusively listen to my music on shuffle and its a constant annoyance of hearing the same band several times over without hearing anything from other bands that are included in the current shuffle mix Im listening to. Its not a exclusive Poweramp issue as Ive had the same complaint with ipods forever. Perhaps you could include a option to not replay the same artist band without playing a song from every other artist band first. Or at least not repeat songs from the same album until all other albums have had one song played. Thanks. CT		08 July 2011 - 04:38 PM	crowningturtle	
crossfade when shuffle enableddisabled	Please could I request an additional crossfade option, simply the ability to apply crossfade when shuffle is enabled (or disabled). Currently the non-gaplessnon-cue crossfade option does not function correctly in my experience but this added feature would solve the problem. Apologies if this has already been requested or is in progress. Greatly appreciate your hard work, Poweramp is hands down the best app on my phone.		08 July 2011 - 01:20 PM	screamteam

Is it possible to get this added in?		21 June 2011 - 08:13 AM	Gibbz	[Its a planned feature for PowerAMP v2.0 (viewtopic.php?f=1t=172) Will be supported for mp3mp4flacapewv.];[thanks, cant wait for this release after looking over the log];[will .m4a be included with .mp4? also does this mean that replay gain will not be supported for .wma?];
random album!	This is a fantastic program. Its sleek and beyond functional. I especially like that it supports gapless playback, which for some reason even the Winamp app just doesnt. The one missing feature is the ability to advance to a random album. Im actually surprised that its not available. MortPlayer (which is free) does this beautifully. Im even more surprised that it isnt included in the To Do list for Poweramp. Its the one thing thats keeping me from buying the program right away. (Im still thinking about it.) I tend to use my Android for listening to albums on long road trips so this feature would be very nice so I wouldnt be forced to listen to all my albums in order every time. If I knew for a fact that folder shuffling would be included in future update Id purchase the program right now and gladly wait.		28 June 2011 - 02:41 AM	chinagreenelvis	[Thanks for the feedbackrequest. If you mean Shuffle by list, i.e. just albumother list is shuffled, but song order is the same inside the album - this is planned feature for PowerAMP v2.0. Note that PowerAMP treats almost any list as "album", not just albums, but also folders, artists, playlists, genres, etc., thus it will be able to shuffle by any of these lists.];[Awesome, thats exactly what Im hoping for! Ill definitely be purchasing. One more question: I like the option to resume playback on inserting headphones, especially since the program stops the music when the headphones are removed and my Android has a loose connector. Is there or will there also be an option to also prevent the music from stopping when headphones are removed?];
sound effect please !	I bought Poweramp 2 months ago, and I also recommended my friends and family and in forum too. Many of them bought it too because Poweramp rocks !! But I always wanted Poweramp to add the feature that is should have long time ago, its the sound effect.. especially "Wide" effect Ive been using in my built in music player in Galaxy S for long time but its gone when I switched over to Poweramp. Oh it will be nice to allow Poweramp to use the 5.1 channel that it is in built in music player in Galaxy S too. Thats all		17 June 2011 - 06:03 PM	chiangeg	[PowerAMP v2.0 has stereo wideningcrossfeed3d sort of effect (already implemented in dev builds). The actual sound produced by this FX is controlled by knob similar to basstreble - from light widening to pretty hard 3d effect on extreme level. Combined with the Bass, it sounds similar to SRS or to Samsungs 5.1 (or even better ). But PowerAMP version is somewhat user configurable, you configure the FX level, you configure bass level, etc. VS just onoff. Thanks for the feedback anyways.];[It took you sometime to approvereply this topic (I know you must be busy with upcoming 2.0), so I actually searched the forum and found the stereo expansion effect is already included in "TODO listfeatures in progress".

auto tagging and analyser	Hi Max, Please try for the auto tagging feature and the spectrum analyser feature. Also wanted to know if we can add lyrics directly from Poweramp or search for it.

artist folder from player	Is there a way to add an option to go to the artist folder of the song I am playing? There are many times that I shuffle my music, and upon hearing a particular artist, I get in the mood to listen to that artists music. To do so, I am required to navigate through the menus. While only a minor nuisance, it would be nice if there were a button added or a gesture that would perform this task.		28 June 2011 - 02:08 AM	Jarosg	[Currently, by click on titlealbumartist PowerAMP goes to the current played list.

Thank you!];
equilizer for each song...	Hi, i would love the following: Well, each song needs an individual equilizer setting for perfect sound. So what do you think to give us the option to safe setting to each song? i.e. When i set up the EQ while a song is playing ther could be a save option "safe to actual song" and PA could write a smal eq-info-file into the song folder. Next time the song is playing this file could be read out by PA. Greetings from Germany Fokus		19 June 2011 - 12:42 PM	fokus	[Hi, this is already possible (PowerAMP v1.3+), you can assign equalizer presets to a song or whole "current" played list (folderalbumartistetc.).

search on artistalbumsong while playing.	Someone else described this and its a feature Id like to see implemented. Another music player had it implemented in a way that I thought worked very well. With this music player when you pressed on the current playing info section youd get a popup. It was context sensitive and had 3 options. Search on Current Artist, Search on Current Track, Search on Current Album. Hitting the specific option would fire off the search. Would make it easy to find remixes of a current song, the rest of the album or even all songs made by that artist. Loving Poweramp BTW. Heads and toes above the other Android music players.		28 June 2011 - 10:52 AM	DarienA	[Thanks for the request.

Still, there is planned support for adding licensed lyrics download to PowerAMP v2.0 (more on this here- viewtopic.php?f=1t=172). Thanks!];
store current random playlist for next use	I have a giant folder of songs which I select to shuffle and listen to while out and about. When I go back into power amp, the current song is the last one I was listening to, but it says it is track 1 of however many are in the folder even though I had already listened to 30 tracks. As I keep listening, I often find the next random tracks are ones I heard in my previous session. It would be awesome if power amp wrote that shuffled playlist to memory and recalled its progress on next load. This would allow me to eventually listen to each song in that shuffle list once over numerous sessions provided I only hit play when restarting the program and not choosing something new to listen to. Thanks		20 June 2011 - 01:20 AM	elgorbo	[+1 I too would prefer the random playlist be maintained between sessions. Ideally never play the same song twice until you have played every song, then just start over with the entire set re-randomized.];[But this was already added recently from my request... Create a playlist of what you want, then go into the playlist and do random shuffle sort. It will then play through that list maintaining its position between sessions (even to the second of the song you were playing) and play each song just once.];

batch mode for adding songs to playlist	The only annoying thing about this app is the fact that when im putting together a playlist, I have to choose each song individually (unless theyre all in the same albumartistplaylistgenre) and then hit add to playlist.

listlog of last songs played	Hi everybody, I give you an idea for a new feature: it would be great if the program logged all the song playedskipped, giving the possibility to know the title of songs listened even hours or days after you listen them. I use my mp3 reader driving my car, and many times I felt the need to know the title of one of the songs I listened to in the last hour, even if I couldnt look at the display during the playback. The log should be similar to this: June 18 2010: Time 08.33.40: Nirvana - "Lithium" Time 08.37.25: Take That - "Back for good" (skipped) Time 08.38.00: Peral Jam - "Alive" June 17 2010: ...

This is the current playlist which will be played and then the player stops. i can search throughout my whole collection with the search bar and look for certain songs or albums. i can either start one song of the new result list und i have a new "now playing" list, the old one is gone. or i can choose "play next" and the results will be added to the current "now playing" list. how can i archieve this wis Poweramp? in Poweramp i can add a folder or an album and start playing. but i dont have a "now playing" list? however, after finishing the album the player starts playning random music? how can i quickly add a song to the now playing list when i have 3000 songs and severeal folders on my sd? for example: i am listening to album abc in folder abc. now i feel like to listen to one certain song called zyx in folder zyx, but after this song i want the player to continue to play album abc. when using the search button, i cannot search the whole library. i have to go to the library, select all songs, hit the search button, enter song name, and then what? in media monkey i select play next and the song is next in my "now playing" list. or i am listening to a folder with 500 tracks. i am listening to song a and song b is next. now i feel like listening to song z but i want to continue with b after z. possible? 2) When using folders i would like the option to open a folder including all subfolders! 3) using genre: i checked and double checked: i tagged all my songs with the genre "electro".

volume reset function	First off, thank you for an incredible music player! Its by far the best. Ive been using it almost every day on my HTC Desire for about 6 months. My suggestionrequest: I use my phone both with headphones and connected to my stereo. When I connect it to the stereo I want the volume to be set to maximum. When Im using headphones, however, I do not want to have the volume set to max of obvious reasons. The auto-resume playback feature when a jack is inserted is awesome, but it doesnt recognize if Im plugging in my stero or headphones(of course), so I have to open Poweramp and manually adjustcheck the volume in fear of getting my brains blown out before I plug in my headphones. This kind of eliminates the advantage of the auto-resume feature and could be fixed with an option that lets you set a default volume level that is used every time a jack is inserted and prevents any uncomfortable accidents! Hope this is clear and understandable, if not, please comment! Thanks again, and keep up the good work! Sindre		18 June 2011 - 03:23 PM	sindr

back button	Currently when back button is pressed while player is on screen it exits the player. What it should do is go back to the cd, and then to the library. It is quite counter productive to have the home button and back button do the exact same thing. So hopefully this was already planned for 2.0, if not, please look into it. It would make navigation much much better. -Nestor		13 June 2011 - 04:35 AM	nestor

switch audio to bluetooth	I have an HTC Evo 4G with Android 2.3.3.

support for two sd cards	I am new to Android and have just bought a Flytouch 2 Android Tablet PC with two 16GB sd cards installed - showing as C: and D: The Poweramp was one of the first apps I installed, and it is indeed a great player. It looks great on my 10" screen. I miss the possibility to select a musicfolder on the second sd card (D:) - or to select multible music folders on both cards at the same time.

I support +1];[Max,I would Like to hear your input on this topic.The new Samsung Galaxy S2 smartphone reportedly has support for USB OTG (USB On-The-Go) feature and you know what that means right. It means multiple usb peripherials e.g. usb flash drives connected to our Android devices and it would be truly awesome if Poweramp had the ability to access those other disk directories too in the same way as it can access an existing sd card.];[PowerAMP v1.2 should detect these sd cards now, if their mount points are inside mnt directory (i.e. something like mntsdcard or mntexternalsdcard or like that). Thanks!];[Well,the Samsung Galaxy SII (S2) as yo already know supports USB On-the-go (OTG) function, its a great feature that Sammy added ..Anyways, the moun point for any externally plugged in usb stick for the OTG is sdcardusbStoragesda..If a usb hub is attached to the Galaxy S2 with multiple usb sticks plugged in then there would be it could be sda,sdb,sdc etc but sda is the primary usb stick if only one is plugge in ever.according to these sources;Hope this helps for if further optimizations for this feature is needed in future Poweramp versions];[Hi, On this date there seems to be no support for two sd cards... My android file manger sees them both, why cant Poweramp? I really need this second card guys! regards robert Android 2.1 10 inch tablet];
songartistalbum display	Hi, Poweramp is the best player Ive seen and I am about to purchase it. The one thing I would like to see changed is a setting to adjust the text brightnes levels for the Song, Artist and Album display. On my HTC incredible in most light settings I can barely read the album information and outside its basically invisible. Thanks, James		09 June 2011 - 03:07 PM	James1910	
albums view should have a large picture thumbs	It would be awesome if we could browse by Album art images in the "Albums" library list of Poweramp. Perhaps a toggle view setting. I also think the thumbs should be smaller than PlayerPros		08 June 2011 - 06:42 PM	haddy	
recently added playlist	Would it be possible to add the "Recently Added Playlist" that comes with the stock music player to Poweramp? This would really help people like me that purchase mostly "Singles" and not full albums. Id like to listen to the latest music ive added to my device and the Recently Added Playlist would be perfect.		02 November 2010 - 05:09 PM	wowser	[I think that its necessary to make Poweramp the ultimate player. The possibility to sort by rating is also a important feature for me. Thanks for the job!];[Hi, thanks for the request. I also think that some sort of recenthistory list could be useful. The only problem here is that for Folders mode, very optimized custom database is used, while for System library, Androids standard media database is used and its not easily possible to combine both in one List, thus it means there will be 2 recent lists (for folders and for library), which is not acceptable. This can change with addition of the custom fast Library in one of the next major releases of PowerAMP.];[I would like to add my support for the Most Recently Added Tracks playlist request.Thanks for a great product. I look forward to 2.0 and the possibility of this feature.Mike];[My strong support for this request here as well.];
musicians#39; practice features	OK, Im a musician, and Poweramp is REALLY the best out there for plugging into my practice amp and playing along.But, AS a musician, there are certain features Id LOVE to see in a music player that I cannot find anywhere: here are the big three:The ability to have any mix of these three facilities active at any one time.Sooooo... what are the chances, and how do we go about this?Martin Bartlett		06 June 2011 - 03:43 PM	bassmanitram	[Hi,Obviously I cannot answer your questions but I just wanted to input my following replies.You mean Playback Speed (tempopitch adjusting), was already requested: viewtopic.php?f=3t=856the developer would definitely know this one.Do you mean A-B repeat, see my older request: viewtopic.php?f=3t=478];[Well there ya go, Im not alone. Yes, pitch control, playback speed control and A-B loops are exactly what Im talking about so one more vote for each. Thx for the response];[Oooooh - well seems "Audio Speed Changer" can do speed control and A-B loops - but it would still be great to integrate that functionality in Poweramp. And, frankly, of the three, pitch changing is the more important - because with the other two Id normally be working on a single piece for a while so Audio Speed Changer is a good solution, but for play-along playlists pitch changing would be the bees knees!];[Yes I want these in Poweramp too];
lr channel balance controls	I am 25 deafer in one ear than the other and I have registered on this website just to tell you that you should add the function to be able to control the LR channel balance. Surely it cant be difficult, even my old Nokia running ancient Symbian had that feature.. So please, please add balance control to the program!		09 May 2011 - 03:56 PM	mynameisneo	[hi is balance control features going to be added in the v2.0 summer updates 2011? thanks];
default music app	Power Amp cannot be made to be the default music app in 2.3.4. As a result, you cannot do a search from the Google Search Widget on Power Amp. Best you can do is allow it to search on the default Music App or Winamp. This means you will not be using Power Amp from a google search of your own device. Should be an easy fix if the free Winamp allows this.		06 June 2011 - 07:53 PM	rscarawa	
volume slidergesture	Is there a way to access the volume directly instead of going to the EQ screen? Or maybe gestures? Or would this be something that would be working with skins on the 2.0 release?		03 June 2011 - 09:08 PM	miketunes	
more dynamic playlist options; artist search in playlists	Would like the ability to add songs to the end of an active playlist with options to make the default behavior never wipe the active playlist, and allow me to easily rearrange songs or groups of songs in the active playlist (for instance, put a full album after the currently playing song, even though there are a hundred songs already queued up after it), and the ability to quickly search and jump to a song in the active playlist (so if I feel like listening to all my soundtracks on shuffle, but want to start with that chuck berry song from Pulp Fiction, I could add a "soundtracks" playlist to the active playlist, then type in "chuck" and easily find it, rather than scrolling through a thousand songs to get to it).		03 June 2011 - 02:28 PM	superboxmonkey

Thanks!];
custom tag displays over song text area	Hi again,As you can see the song text area within the player is laid out as in descending order, track title, album and then folder directory.However I would like the ability to customize this display to display custom tags instead, just like how similarly in foobar2000 the display pane of tag fields can be user-customized; http:www.hydrogena... ... opic=85639You see, I want to be able to customize the display of the song text area in Poweramp. I know already that song info can be viewed in the info screen but this is not what I mean. If Poweramp could have a Lyrics feature then surely this feature idea should deserve the same attention too.For example, If the ability existed, I could replace the text of folder directory and in its place choose a metadata tag to display instead and it would display (if its in the file). So if the composer tag was in the file of my mp3s and flacs and I set the composer tag as a custom display tag, then I would want that text to display as "Composer: Blah Blah" without the quotes in that same song text area.Same for any or all tags, they would display with the prefix of a colon ":"Composer:Publisher:Copyright:Encoded by:Band:...... And more.Additionally there could be more text-animation which would better visually highlight to the user the use of these tags such as:-standard auto-scrolling text (already exists)-flash-appear inout-slow blinking-text scrolls in, stops, scrolls out again		02 June 2011 - 04:59 PM	haddy	
disable folder buttons	Sorry if this has been mentioned already. Ive searched through the options, but cannot find a function to turn off the back and forward folder buttons. I never use them and to be honest, I see no point in them. Ive accidentally tapped them a couple times and it takes me right out of the song Im listening to and into a different album by a different artist and it just plain old sucks! Sorry, no offense intended.		02 June 2011 - 08:09 AM	griff	
artistalbum return from #39;now playing#39; screen	Is there any way that you could implement a go to artist or go to album or even a go to folder button on the now playing screen that will bring you straight to the list of songs of the artist, album, or folder of the current song being played? Thanks! PS. I have had this music player for about 7 months now and in my opinion it is still the best one out there! I recommend it to everyone! Great work!		01 June 2011 - 06:37 PM	B_rian	
3 feature requests + 1 possible bug	First off I must say that Poweramp is by FAR the most advanced, thoroughly updated app available on the Market in its class. I used it for the first time yesterday evening and was absolutely elated. I have a few feature requests that I believe may improve the apps usability: 1. Downloaded album art should be available to be saved directly to the id3 tag file. Additionally, more id3 tag editing functionality would be very nice indeed. 2. Playpause and track forwardback buttons should be added to system pull-down menu. (presently, users may only open the app when the Android pull-down menu is visible instead of control the music being played.) 3. BATCH OPERATIONS: similar to the iPod Touch and the iPhone music players, this feature would allow the manipulation of more than one file at a time or less than a whole group of files at a time rather than only being able to, for example, add one file at a time to a playlist, or an entire folder or search results. These batch operations would be a simple check-box interface and could be used for deletions, playlist creation, moving music from folder to folder, etc. Were these features added, I would have no problem paying twice as much for this app! (: Now for the one bug I found that may be a local problem on my device: I am running Froyo (2.2.1) on my Verizon Samsung Fascinate. In the "Lock Screen Options" settings menu, I cant seem to get the "Direct Unlock" option to work right for me (even after reloading the application, rebooting my device, and some other troubleshooting). I would love to unlock directly to the home screen, but every time my device is lock and I attempt unlocking, I have to go through the system unlock even though the "Direct Unlock" setting is checked. Is this something that other users are having trouble with too? I think this is a great feature that would definitely put the app ahead of others, but it seems to work the same as the rest.		26 May 2011 - 01:21 PM	stevederocher	[Thanks for the feedback! 1. it wont work for automatic album art download (as image writing to tag will require playback stop or can cause skips on phones with slow flash, like SGS), it could work for manual downloading, though, its not user friendly this way. 2. if you mean status bar pull down notifications window, Android will close this window each time any button is pressed inside it, and also, the size of the notification "block" is fixed. This is why its not implemented for Androids 2.x, for Android 3.x its possible and will be implemented. 3. PowerAMP can add multiple files to playlists (either complete list or filtered songs), but yes, separate item selection is also planned (at least for deletionadding to playlist and tag editing). Re: direct unlock - lock screen functionality in Android is not standard, it basically means every phoneROMOEM does it differently, thus, it works on some phones (mostly the phones I have locally for testing) and can fail others. Though it should work on almost all phones from Samsung Galaxy series, I wonder why it doesnt work for your Fascinate, it can be also caused by some other app with lock screen replacement, of by, for example, android secure lock screenpin enabled. Thanks!];[Thank you for your thorough reply! Just a couple follow-up questions: When do you anticipate integration of the separate item selection into a release? Specifically, I have the Fascinate I-500, which I understand may be quite different than the other versions of the Fascinate. Could you look in to fixing this bug for this version specifically? It would be greatly appreciated (: Also, unrelated to my previous questions: I noticed this application supports headset controlsbuttons, but Im not quite clear on which headset is necessary for this functionality. I searched the internet quite thoroughly a couple weeks ago for an "android" headset with such controls, but only came up with either a) ipod headset controls or 1 or 2 generic models of low-grade android headset controls only "compatible" with specific models. Can you tell me if all headset controls work with the android or there is a list of android-compatible models that you have access to? Id imagine you had to do some testing when the headset button support was added. Thanks again for your thorough reply and such a great app!];[For what its worth, I can confirm that Zagg Smartbuds work fine with my Motorola Defy. There is a button to startpause or answer phone calls when pressed once. Twice for next track, thrice for previous track, as well as a microphone for phone calls. There is also a slider volume which works independently of the phones volume. From what I read, they should be compatible with the majority of Android phones.];
list of suggestions from a new user	Sorry if some of these have been mentioned already :oops: 1. Im not sure of the reason (maybe someone can explain) but when entering playlists, it has to load which can take a few seconds, can playlists be cashed for faster access? 2. Show the currently playing playlist on the player screen so we know which playlist were on While flicking between them using gestures on the album art. 3. Maybe add the option to show Song info on the player screen. (year, track, genre, composer 8-) ) I would especially like the year to be shown. 4. The addition of a "now playing" screen that can be reordered. Example: if 60s rock playlist is playing, it will show that playlist in the now playing screen and can be reordered without reordering the actual playlist, and make it so that the now playing screen can be saved as a playlist. (look at player pro as a better example) 5. Make it so that a single tap on the album art both opens and closes the lyrics screen, rather than having to tap the little "X" to close, which can be tedious. 6. Make it an option to use the volume rockers long press as previousnext buttons, also with the option of using the volume buttons to "wake" the phone. 7. Add ratings. 8. Add composer to the library screen. 9. Allow customization of the lock screen "unlock" button. I much prefere a slider over a button. 10. Not sure if its a bug, but Poweramp has added content from my ringtone folder even though the folder isnt selected in the options. Excellent player BTW, keep up the good work.		25 May 2011 - 06:20 PM	dieharddan	[Also, I noticed Poweramp is a little power thirsty, any plans on improving battery consumption?];
flac sorting and library	I would like to see the Library recognize all file types or at least have the option to sort by track # in Folder view. For me I have albums of FLAC files that dont show up in the Library, only in "Folders". What is frustrating is that they are sorted by alphabetically by title, I want them sorted by track number, same as the CD. FYI, I love Poweramp, its a quantum leap beyond other players, Thanks, Chris		24 March 2011 - 09:47 PM	YoDudeRock	[Thanks for the requestsfeedback.];[Hello: First, I agree with YoDudeRock. GREAT product, so thank you. I rip CDs as flac only (for the sound quality) as do many other android users (take a look at the Android forum). I use J River Media Center as my player on my laptop, and it syncs well with my HTC Inspire. Poweramp plays the flac files very well, and the sound is fantastic. The only problem is that the files will only appear in Folder view, not in Library view. The good news is that the artwork, song titles, etc. (all tags) are there. The bad news is that when you click on Library, there is nothing in Album, Artist, Songs, etc. And, like mentioned, when you open an album from the Folders, the trackssongs are listed in alphabetical order only, not by track number. This is a problem for classical and most jazz albums. Now, they play just fine, and curiously, all the tag info is there, including correct track number. I.e., if you play a song and click on info, it will show you the correct track number! The system will just not sort by track number, even if you tell it to sort by track number in the settings. So, is there a way to get the Folder files into Library? If not, is there a way to get the albums in the Folders to sort songs by track number (especially since the correct number is in the tag information)? If not, I think there would be a lot of people willing to pay for that ability. I reviewed the Android forum and there are a lot of flac file users asking for that function in the embedded program (which is lousy). And I think they are like me, they would pay more money to have that ability. So if you could do that, please!!! As far as I can tell you would be the only ones, and if word got out, I would not be the only one willing to pay a lot extra to get it. I look forward to your reply, and in the meantime, thanks for the excellent service and product!!!!];[Hi, Flacs in library requires custom library - currently PowerAMP uses the android media library. Custom library is planned for PowerAMP v2.0, this will bring flacs and other non-standard formats to the PowerAMP library, but things like shared library playlists will be lost. Thanks!];[Hey maxmpz: If it stays as it is (in folder mode all the artwork and songs are in each album), and the songs are in track order, then I will be one happy camper, and will buy another copy just to say thanks!!!! And will try to convince all my Android using buddies to download Poweramp. It is a great service you are providing. Oh, I will also alert all members of Audiogon (I am a silly audiophile and have been a member there for many years) that this app exists, since most of them use flac, but have given up on finding a player that plays flac on Android. Thanks so much, and cant wait!!!];[A quick workaround in the meantime: Download a music tagging program like MP3Tag for Windows (a powerful freeware program that works on all formats including FLAC). You can merely point it to your Android SD card, and tell it to rename all files based on criteria you set. You could keep all files in place and rename them to "[track] [title].flac" (that is, "01 Song Name.flac"), or even have them moved to folders of your choice: #092;[artist]#092;[album]#092;[track] [title].flac. Renaming the files to include the track number would fix your Folders sorting solution.];[Purchased Full version around two weeks ago and very happy, but was a little disappointed to find out that I can not use the library function as 95 of my music is FLAC. So, very much looking forward to the "custom library" support in v2.0.];[PowerAMP v2.0 allows any supported format in Library, including flacs. Also, it fixes some android library issue (like genres or artist tag issues), and have about x10 scanning speed (10-15 seconds to scan 1000 new files into library - android does this in about 240 seconds (nexus 1 - 2.3.4).];[v2.0 sounds bad ass. Is there a tentative release date?];
quot;list item click actionquot; addition	Could you consider adding an additional action to the "List Item Click Action" menu? I would like to see an option to bring up the long press menu by a single tap. This would prevent interrupting a playlist by accidentally tapping a song when browsing, you could choose to cancel the action or select one of the long press menu options. This would make passing around a phone at parties to let other people en-queue a song much easier, people in various stages of inebriation cant seem to help tapping a song by accident. Even sober people do it far too often. Cheers.		18 May 2011 - 01:28 AM	duk	[Almost every PowerAMP list item has small arrow to the right - this opens "long press" menu. Sensitive area for it is actually wider, you dont need to hit exactly the arrow. Thanks!];
soundcheck option available?	Hi, I recently installed Poweramp and I like it very much so far. I only miss (or havnt foound) a sound check option like in iTunes or on the iPod so that all songs have approximately the same volume level. Is there such an option? Id also love to see an horizontal lockscreen widget. Ive added a post to an oler thread where someone already requested that. Thank you for help!		19 May 2011 - 12:26 PM	Hork	[This is called normalization, compression or (to some extent) replay gain. Support for something like this is planned for PowerAMP, though, due to the way sound is mixed on android, its almost not possible to make it louder without changing the master volume (which has very rough steps). Thanks!];
tap screen to pause	I think it would be great to have the ability to simply tap the screen (or at least the lock screen) to pause a song. I love the ability to use gestures to skip tracks on the locked screen; it makes it a very car-friendly music player and is why Im considering purchasing it. However, when I need to pause a song I have to tap where I think the pause button is going to be, or I have to look at the screen - something I want to avoid while driving. Or, another possibility is to shake the player in order to pause. I like whatever is eyes free.		19 May 2011 - 01:25 PM	sadastronaut	[Thanks for the request. Currently tap on the album art area is used to bringhide PowerAMP album art widgets, and any other place is also press sensitive (buttons or other UI elements).];
higher volume	(Maybe this can be solved on my phone directly with some hack, but...) It would be great to be able to turn up the volume much more. I did set the reply gain to 89db (with Media Monkey) so I have not to change volume constantly. But on my phone (HTC Desire Z) the music plays really quit on my headphones. I have set the "preamp" in Poweramp to the max (and volume too) and still its not loud enough (and I am not talking about ear killing madness! - riding in the subway is often more loud than my music with really good headphones ). Is there any solution for me? Would a higher preamp make sense? Cheers Joachim		27 May 2011 - 08:35 AM	Morgenstern72	[You can get more volume from PowerAMP (for example, by using LOUD equ preset, adjusting preamp, etc.), but: - you can damage your hearing. Due to this, almost all phones limit max volume (though, there are hacks to remove limit, like Voodoo driverapp) - if you amplify basses, some dynamic range is required, but songs are usually already normalized, thus negative preamp is needed. In this case master volume helps. Thanks!];[I do not want some ear breaking voume, just a volume that my songs -which replay gain is at 89db- play normal I just bought VolumeBoost from the market which does this trick without the need of a rooted phone];

wifi phonephone controls	I have a year old phone no longer being used as a phone. I would like to use that old phone as a jukebox, and control it with my new phone via home WiFi.

However all that I have found are phone to PC. Poweramp is a really good music app, which would be awesome remotely controlled phone to phone.];[And we are loading up all our phones in anticipation of the phone to phone capabilty. Amazing how many folks want the capability once the inception happens.];[this would be plain awesome an app with widgets(album art and current song on remote phone) that can interface with Poweramp on another phone over network. I would gladly pay another fee for an app that does this.];
modular widgets for tabs	it would be nice to have a widgets with the following: only Album art (eg just a picture frame that show the album art), preferably resizeable with various launchers. control buttons eg. large playpause button, prev and next. would be nice to have them as resizeable with different launchers. I know there already buttons like this but something Built for power amp would be nice. separate volume widget and effects widget. Basicly I have a Galaxy 7" Tab that spends part of its life as an in care player. the above widgets would allow for layouts across multiple screens. EG. player controls and album art on one screen and EQ sliders on another. Larger play and pause buttons for easer in car access and general use. ps, i love the App very good and well worth the money paid for it removes the need to run from with in the app wile driving.		01 June 2011 - 03:45 AM	dogz85	
formats	Ok, Poweramp rocks. Ive been wanting a good flac player with features of a Mp3 player. Tried Poweramp a while back but moved on. Retried and the updates were phenomenal. Bought it, bought 32 gb card for EVO. Play only flac files. Anyways, will there be any additional formats codecs in the future? I would really like a dts wav quad sound capability. I do not even know if it would-be possible. EVO might only have stereo out. But do not know limitations of Bluetooth. I use Poweramp primarily on my commute to work. Will be upgrading my head unit in my truck soon. Will have to just use cds for surround sound. Great app. Thanks!		01 June 2011 - 03:10 AM	wader999	
gapless as the 68 built + replay gain	Great player but I like the gapless in the 68 built and I was disappointed to not have it in the last built. Replay gain is also a features I would like in this player.		02 November 2010 - 12:56 PM	bob akane	[I was wondering, why use Replay gain when you can use MP3gain and have it work on any MP3 player? Ive been using it for years, and the way it modifies the header means it will work in any software but can be completely undone (erased) by the same app without harming the file. I use it to level out most of my tracks, save for classical music where I level the entire album at once.];[Thanks for the request. There was no gapless in build 68, and on my test devices I have the same minimal pause between tracks (PowerAMP first always tries to start the playing first, then it updates UIalbum artetc.). Though, on some devicesspecific firmwares there can be some difference - due to the new features added.];[For me, replaygain is still the better way to level your mp3s. I have applied replaygain to all my mp3s and its working perfect. With replaygain youre able to set the volume level for the single track and for the whole album.With the right replaygain support in power-amp it would be possible to activate the replaygain-level for the album in normal playmode and the single-track-level in shuffle mode.The only thing that has to be implemented is the general replaygain support and an option in the configuation menu to decide which replaygain level has to be applied.The options in the menu should be like this:Replaygaintype:- Albumgain (Maintain a constant volume level between albums, but keep any intentional volume variations between songs in an album. (If album gain value is not available, uses track gain information))- Trackgain (Maintain a constant volume level between tracks. If track gain value is not available, no replaygain is applied.)- Trackgain if shuffling (Maintains a constant volume between tracks if Shuffle is set to Yes. Reverts to album mode if Shuffle is set to No.)- Off (Do not process replaygain information, i.e. turn off the replaygain function.)The implementation of replaygain would be perfect!!!!];[How many apps support this methodology? I guess that since I dont see it in any car players and the vast majority of portable softwarehardware players, using MP3gain just worked for me. It is interesting though, and Id like to see how its implemented in another app to try it out.];[How many apps support this methodology?

Cool.];[I also use replay gain in rockbox (with a cowon X5 and apple nano gen2) and foobar2000.

Should be available as option in next major release.];[Id also love replay gain to be implemented.For this, I have a suggestion: on my Squeezebox music system I get the option to use what they call Smart gain. When this is set the player uses teh track gain tag when playing from playlists and teh album tag when playing from an album. This way the user doesn;t need to switch between album gain and track gain modes each time they want to play a mix of tracks vs a whole album.I dont see the problem here - if a user doesnt apply the tags to a certain song then it means they dont want to (and you cant) apply any replay gain. This just seems like expected behaviour - of course there would be a sudden volume jump.];[+1 for ReplayGain support, the volume jump could be avoided by having a "fall-back gain" setting which would be applied for songs without a ReplayGain tags. A "pre-amp gain" setting would also be nice to change the overall volume level before ReplayGain is applied.];[Hi Max, please dont forget the implementation of replaygain support in the next major update!];[One reason is MP3gain works only on mp3, not flac or other formats. Also, MP3gain doesnt only modify the header, it changes the audio data as well, but in such a way that it can be modified upward or downward or removed to restore the original data. Using replay gain, the audio data, regardless of format, is untouched.];[The volume jump can be avoided in most cases, with separate configurable preamp levels for songs with and without replay gain tags.];[Another vote for Replay Gain, thats one of my favorite features in any audio player.];[Yes. I would love ReplayGain in Poweramp.];
stop after 1-play and quick playlist	Pretty simple.Stop after 1-Play featureWhat: A play-option in the REPEAT section, that stops playback after the current song finishes. i.e. noncontinuous play i.e. prevents playing the next songWhy: Often I like to listen to just one song on my phone, just once, and Id love not having to open up my phone each time and hit the pause button after a song finishesHow: First two are already in there, the third is what should be includedRepeat all songsRepeat current songNon-continuous playQuick playlistA feature to allow marking of songs and then adding those marked songs to a playlist. Unless someone can direct me to a faster way of creating a playlist than, 1) *hold song name* 2) *add to pl* 3) *select playlist*Danke!		31 May 2011 - 12:48 AM	DarXide	
playlist launch widget	I would really like to be able to launch a playlist directly from a widget. This should allow for multiple widgets each configured for a different playlist. The built in music player has this and I miss it now that I am using Poweramp.		29 May 2011 - 09:14 AM	desperado

poweramp for iphone	Ive been using Poweramp since the beginning on my Droid phone, and it is superb. I just added an iPhone 4 to my Verizon account for my daughter, but she changed her mind and took my Droid. Please tell me there is a chance there will be a Poweramp for iPhone? Ive looked high and low in that much touted Apple app store, and nothing compares - Best, IM		27 May 2011 - 12:51 AM	Imageman	[1. Apple would likely not allow the app on its AppStore (their tight-ass stringent anti-competition policies) 2. IOS apps are in the Objective C programming language. 3. A Cross-platform GUI would be a BIG job on the developers time. 4. Fk the Iphone. Its all about Android. Android is open, flexible customizable and is only gettin better.

And with the option to change between oldest to newest and newest to oldest...		26 May 2011 - 03:15 AM	griff	[As it happens, I was thinking along the same lines the other day, as most of my listening involves choosing an artist and then working my way through their output chronologically. However, I can understand that when compared to other Poweramp projects, this one may seem a tad frivolous.];
re-order tracks	Would it be possible to make all "currently playing" tracks able to be re-ordered? When playing from the queue this can be done, but not when you select an album and its playing.		26 May 2011 - 03:14 AM	griff	
feature request: google music support (ifwhen possible)	May be a longshot, and may not even be possible, but once Google music is ubiquituous, it would be cool if we could access our music stored on our Google music account via Poweramp. Im not sure if Google is going to make that possible, but I dont want to listen through the lame Google Music app. I want my cloud of 20k songs accessible through Poweramp. Im just saying that if they make the ability for other players to access a users Google Music account (via a google account permission), it should be a priority to add this feature.		25 May 2011 - 02:53 PM	jakemg	[Would all depend on an open or (fee) accessible API for Android app developers];[Yep. Which is why I said, "...if they make the ability for other players to access a users Google Music account (via a google account permission)..."];
folder management - exclude, include, clear cache	I dont know exactly how Poweramp interfaces with folders and how it keeps track of them. That said... I AM aware that you can select folders in the program, etc. The problem is... There are certain folders that I DE-SELECT from that very list...and I subsequently rescan...that Poweramp still accesses in the playlist. I do not WANT this folder in the playlist but it still plays files from this folder. Its a folder of ringers that Ive made for my phone. I dont want them in my list when I go SHUFFLE ALL in Poweramp. The folder has been checked, unchecked, rechecked, unchecked again...and it still plays my ringers during shuffle mode. Can we get some clarification on how Poweramp handles folders? Or EVEN BETTER... "Exclude" specific folders.		09 May 2011 - 09:43 AM	BlackMoonWolf	[I would like a way to prevent some folders containing ringtones and voice notes from appearing in Poweramp Library. I have Poweramp set to only include one folder for my music but this only seems to apply in Folder view. They are still visible in Library view. One solution is to prevent these folders from being added is to put a .nomedia file each folder, but this method can result in files being deleted by the media scanner so I am reluctant to try.];[This feature should have been included yonks ago. I actually thought it already existed. In another favourite Android app of mine, called QuickPic (its an image viewer), there is the ability to HideExclude folders from being displayed and scanned. This is needed for PA too and should be straightforward to implement.];
short rewind on resume on bt connect.	I have been using Poweramp for a few weeks now and it does much more than I need, thank you very much. One of the places I use it is in the car connected to the stereo through bluetooth. In that mode it starts and stops the audio playback depending on if BT in the car is active or not. That works great but because of connection lag the player starts a few seconds before the audio is actually switched on the stereo. And similarly when the car and BT are shut off, the player is still running until the phone recognizes BT has gone away. This causes a several second gap of audio content. Not good for podcasts or audio books. These connection lags are inherent in most BT connections so a small change to your program can help out us podcastaudio book listeners. Put a setting in to back up the player 5 or ten seconds on BT resume. You could even have the rewind amount be user settable. This is also good for podcasts and audio books to refresh where you were the last time you where listening to the audio. Just my 2 cents. Great program!		25 May 2011 - 02:21 AM	T^2	
full-screen coverart	Thanks for a great app! One feature that would be really great to have is the ability to show album cover-art full screen (perhaps with startstopbackforward buttons that could be shown overlaid when pressing the screen while in full-screen mode). This would be amazing for presenting audio tracks with individual coverart, and would be a great visual effect overall. Really hope this can be implemented in an upcoming version! Thanks, - Pete		24 May 2011 - 07:50 PM	petejens	
merge folder view and library view together	I think current folder view is too complicated to use: the songs in folder view could only be add to folder playlist, and if you choose a parent folder to play, you can see the songs in only one child folder at the same time. I hope the folder view could be parallel with artist, album or genre v. iew and in the library .then the songs in folder view and artist view could be add to same playlist. And in library, instead of just show the name of different views(artist,album,etc),also display their contents. You can take playerpro, another player on android as a reference. and i want the contents dynamic queue could be changed automatically. For example, if i choose a parent folder to play the contents of the dynamic queue will be all the songs in this folder,sorted by their paths. All what i said is very common in other mobile players. There is no need to be different that users cannot accustom to it.		24 May 2011 - 05:34 PM	deathell	
playlist shortcut support?	Hello, One of the most important features, for me, is playlist shortcut support, so I can start listening my playlists without having to enter the player and search for that playlist. Other players like Winamp and Mixzing support that, but not Poweramp. When will this be implemented?		23 May 2011 - 08:52 PM	Phantom75	[Absolutely and I thought that this was already supported. All sorts of playlist files should be supported such as: * .m3u * .pls * .wpl (Before playback, Poweramp could auto-convert absolute paths [of Windows Media Player] to folder relative paths) * .xspf Good luck Max!];[Actually according to Max himself, Playlist files support (.m3u etc) is planned for v2.0 in this interview here:http:www.androidpo... ... r-android];

poweramp overriding headset control while not being used	Firstly, I really like your program. Miles ahead of any other music player Ive tried (Ive tried a lot) Except for the widget skins (which I know are coming later) the one problem I have is with the headset resume. Is there any way that it wont override whatever is currently playing? Sometimes Im listening to podcasts through google listen, and I want to plug it into my car. But I have to pause it, go to Poweramp, pause the music in Poweramp and then return back to the other program to continue the podcast. ts really convenient thought whenever I just want to put on some music and just plug it in. But I wonder if theres a way to tell Poweramp to hold off whenever Im doing something else?		06 May 2011 - 01:28 AM	drclaw	[First of all, I want to say that I really like Poweramp, and I want to use it. But... I also use a program called "Beyondpod" for listening to podcasts. I want to continue to use it. But when I use a headset (wired or bluetooth) while using beyondpod, Poweramp picks up on the headset controls and overrides beyondpod. This is similar to comments I have read in this forum from the other direction: for example, programs such as Winamp overriding Poweramp. After reading those posts it appears that for devices running froyo (mine is) the last active app should receive the headset signals. The only way I can get beyondpod to work with my headset controls is to disable headset controls in Poweramp. I really want to purchase and use Poweramp, but if I cant seamlessly move between it and Beyondpod, thats a deal-breaker. Any thoughts or instrustions?];[Thanks for the report. PowerAMP v1.4 has raised headset priority as otherwise, some new devices (like Atrix 4g) are just plain dont work with headset controls. I will add option to avoid priority bump for headset controls into PowerAMP v2.0 (which is going to be next update on Market). Thanks again!];[Maxmpz, Thanks for implementing this feature in the latest release of Poweramp. Poweramp and BeyondPod (along with my other audio-related apps) now work well together (when Poweramp is not given high priority). I have now purchased Poweramp and it is my music player of choice.

constant dynamic folder scanning (w custom delay)	Support for minute-by-minute auto-background scanning for missing files within folders - this solution should make sure of avoding that awful failed to play error for files recently removed from my sd card. Addtionally next to this a custom delay time e.g scan ever 30 secs, 1 mins, 5 mins etc Scanning within this feature, if implemented, should not be harsh but likely relaxed (if that makes sense) which should be better for cpu usageless strain on sd card.

asus transformer microsd	Im a new Poweramp user and was trying to set up my music folders on my new ASUS Transformer tablet. The Transformer uses EMMC storage, either 16 or 32GB and its located at mntsdcardxxxx . Theres also a slot for a micro sd card. Its address from system root is RemovableMicroSDxxxx. At this point I cant get to any music on the MicroSD since settings only allows me to get to mntsdcard. Could you add RemovableMicroSDxxxx to your list of folders?

google voice actions	I think Ive tested every music player on the app store and like Poweramp over all the others but I seldom use it. Since most of my music listening is done in the car I need to be able to use Google Voice Commands. This has pretty much forced me to use either WinAmp or CarTunes combined with the CM7 DSP Manager and a separate scripting app. Ive spoken with other CM7 users who also prefer Poweramp but never use it for the same reasons. Is it possible to customize Poweramp to use Google Voice Commands? Also, why cant Poweramp have buttons to run the CM7 DSP scripts?

replay gain	Hi!ReplayGain like its implemented in foobar2000.

I#39;ve spent some time trying other players and checking their forums for this as a future feature request, although it seems there are some difficulties to overcome (eg see this thread http:code.google.c...detail?id=3434) - but the same was said of EQs! I#39;m no expert so have no idea if it can be achieved but for me it#39;s top of the list.I use Foobar for RG scanning after EACLAME rips, and would really love to see Poweramp support RG, and include a limiter similar to Foobar#39;s Advanced Limiter DSP - not much to ask I know![Sorry, slight hijack] misha0209 - just a suggestion, if you use Foobar try setting the RG processing option to "apply gain" only, and in DSP Manager add "Advanced Limiter" to the Active DSPs list - imho better way to manage peak than clipping prevention (I have Preamp set to +9 with RG, and 0 without - roughly based on my RG scan results, so try and see what works best)];[Thistle hi, thanks for the suggestion, believe it or not, "(I have Preamp set to +9 with RG, and 0 without - roughly based on my RG scan results, so try and see what works best)" i had the exact same settings before i changed my dsp chain to the one in the image, i kind of use the channel mixer to make 5.1 output with bass redirection (bass freak ), and then remix it all back to stereo with matrix mixer. so i use apply gain and prevent clipping with a +14 amp (used +12 before the 1.1.6 foobar update, but the developer changed RG algorithm and tracks loose even more volume then before) to get absolute max volume before the info hits dsp chain, because the dsp chain has a drastic toll on volume... anyway, it would be most AWESOME to have something similar to foobar#39;s advanced limiter in Poweramp, to go along with the RG support!];

shuffle, but keep some tracks together	Never seen a player that could do this, but with classical music in particular the tracks are often divided at places you wouldnt really want to start playing randomly. Id love to be able to select a group of tracks in an album and say "keep these together in this order", then if Im playing randomly shuffled songs and it picks one of the tracks in a "keep together" group, then it will play all those tracks together in the proper order before going off to randomly play something else at the end of those tracks.		29 January 2011 - 01:46 AM	TomHorsley	[Thanks for the request.

allow a default setting for sorting library playlists	Im not a big user of many different audio file-types...just itunes stuff mostly, so I am using Library rather than Folder view. Anytime I import a playlist and then view it using Power AMP, I have to manually select how the playlist is sorted the first time I open it, and then only that playlist defaults to that sort when I open it again. I noticed in settings that you have a lot of power over how folders in folder view are sorted. It would be nice to have a default setting that would allow the user to select how playlists will be sorted by default. Also, while in a playlist, it would be nice to have a sort button right on the screen allowing you to toggle through different sorting options without leaving the playlist (eg press the button once, and the playlist is sorted by artist name. press again and it is sorted by song name etc.) All in all though, my compliments on a great app...head and shoulders above any other player ive used, and well worth the purchase price. Thanks!		08 May 2011 - 05:30 AM	river777runner	[PowerAMP doesnt import library playlists or resort it automatically.

dynamic normalization	There are some stand alone music players out there, like most Samsung and Sony players, which have a function that automatically adjusts the volume to make the music play at the same volume, it is called dynamic normalization. Some music files sound softer than others depending on the equipment used to record the music, like music recorded on digital equipment may sound louder than music which is recorded on analog sources like tapes, thats where normalization comes in, it also enables soft parts of a song to play at the same volume as the rest of the song. I think that this might be a nice add on to the next version.		10 May 2011 - 02:02 AM	spookmullett	[The problem with normalization in app is that apps on Android has no access to low level Android sound subsystem (i.e. mixer), thus, it cant manipulate volume so freely. Btw, it looks like each android release has unique sound subsystem and also OEMs adds their varieties, thus they all differ. The maximum volume output power is controlled by global volume (the volume rockers), and this limits usability of any normalizationreplay gainpreampetc that can be done inside usial application like PowerAMP, as you can make volume lower, but you cant make it louder (without changing the global volume, which has huge steps and also changes notification sounds, etc). PowerAMP already sets default preamp volume lower as some dynamic range is required for equalizer. Adding normalization (and to some extent, Replay Gain) requires even lower default preamp (to be able to amplify audio when required) - and this is not well accepted by general user, as it feels like app has (for reason not obvious to user) lower volume. This is why apps like Voodoo sound driver is actually kernel extensions. Thanks.];
poll hardware controls	It would be nice to use the volume rocker, the same way you can use it in idle mode to turn up or down the volume, to use it to skip to the next track or the previews one by holding it down for 3 seconds (i.e.) I remember my old SE phone having this feature, and I really miss it. It is a great player, but in my opinion it’s missing this very simple but useful feature to not have to depend on the touch screen while driving.		11 May 2011 - 04:09 PM	quarryninja	[viewtopic.php?f=3t=843p=6531#p3246 Thanks!];

bluetooth onoff - instead of exit	Im using Poweramp for my music and Doggcatcher for my podcasts and both products work well for what they do and keep me company for the 6 hours a day that I spend in my car. My one complaint though is that they dont play nicely with each other with my Motorola T505 hands-free bluetooth unit. Once I start Poweramp it stays resident on the phone (No - even though an "exit" option would be nice Ive already read the answer to that). If I then start DoggCatcher and press the "pause" button on my Bluetooth unit, PowerAmpt treats it as a request to start playing again even though I wanted DoggCatcher to pick up the request. DoggCatcher has an "exit" option which keeps it from interfering when I just want music so going from podcasts to music works fine. Its the other way around thats the problem. What Id like to suggest is some "master setting" switch that turns onoff Poweramps listening for Bluetooth to give the other app a chance to be controlled. Ideally a big enough button so my fat fingers can hit it without diving through all sorts of menu options. In a perfect world, Poweramp would "know" that theres a Bluetooth device connected and ask upon startup - or when the interface is re-activated if I wanted to connect or not to make it convenient to turn on. For me, this gets around the whole "exit" question - not that I wouldnt like that too - but Ive read the answers on that ... . Thanks for a great product. APB		09 May 2011 - 08:20 PM	abutchart	
shuffle folders	Dear developers, it would be great to have an additional shuffle mode: "Shuffle Folders". Effect of this mode would be: - songs in a folder would be played in original sequence - after playing last song in the folder, next folder would be selected randomly Usually I listen to music in my car. I like to listen to albums as they are, keeping the original sequence of songs, but I would like to listen to randomly selected albums. In this case I wouldnt have to listen always "Bon Jovi" after "AC DC". :-) Thank you for your help. Regards, Kaci		09 May 2011 - 09:56 AM	kaci	
eq numeric adjusters!	hi, This is exactly the best!!! player ive ever seen on any platform! I was loving the stock player of HTC very much but Poweramp made me forget it. But there is a really big thing missing for me though: im very sensitive about EQ settings and i need to adjust EQ very precise! so would it be possible to add numeric adjuster as HTCs stock player please?!!! Regards		25 February 2011 - 03:05 PM	affemrah	[Thanks for the request. What htc stock player do you mean btw (what phone)?];[Sorry for the late reply,didnt check frequently. I meant HTCs own player which comes as defaul with device. I was using Touch HD then HD2 and now Desire HD. All of 3 devices have great sound performance and its getting better at every device upgrade:) But as i said after use your app,i became addicted:) im a pro musician and sound is everything for me! If you could add numeric adjuster to eq, Poweramp gonna be beyond amazing! Im advicing your player everywhere by the way:) Cheers];[hi, we had a discussion with a guy at xda, he said Desire HD is not a good music player and i wrote: Man,sound quality and music never can be stupid discussion. As i said we are kinda spamming thread but i think some of the guys would like to learn and hear about what im gonna say. For me, sound quality is the first in my preferences list while choosing a smartphone or pda or whatever call Tts fatal! I have Beyerdynamic DT150, DT 990 Sennheiser HD595 and UE Triple.Fi 10. I had Touch HD, HD2 and finally Desire HD. Sound quality increased every upgrade for stock player and i was a real stock player lover! I compared all of them before i sold previous. You can understand Desire HDs sound quality even from its hiss level. And i compared Desire HD(of course with my UE) with Iphone3, Iphone4, Ipod Touch and Galaxy S stock players. Desire HD kicks all of them ass!!! Now for a few months im using Poweramp which is superb and i cant describe my pleasure everyday while listening my UE with Desire HD coming and going to work. Cheers and got a reply from other user: always want to try Poweramp, but as soon as i play a song, i notice lower volume than on the stock player, or others like winamp or the new songbird. Do i need to play with the EQ or something ? i recognice its a great app with lots of options, but its "worse" than other playes "out of the box and with no tuning", i think my reply:) hi, i met with Poweramp in my HD2android days, cause HD2s stock players EQ didnt work with ported rom i was using. Im kinda stubborn and loyal on every subject and it was very hard to switch my player but due to exigence (i cant listen wo EQ noway) i started to use Poweramp and booom) Now i cant go with anything but PA) i had a chance to compare side to side stock player of Desire HD and PA and Desire Hds player is really good! but PA better Especially about mid and high frequencies. Of course you should tweak the EQ as your tastes but keep in mind, it would give much better and distortion free sound if you lower the preamp like beneath 50. About sound level, i dont have any complaint cause my phones is in-ear and reduces the outside noise at least 20 decibels. but as i can remember, i didnt notice any sound level difference while comparing with stock player. Strongly recommended!!! Cheers just wanted to share:) by the way, gapless feature is great at newest update! just waiting numeric adjuster:) Cheers];
ideas amp; suggestions for future skin making in poweramp	IdeasSuggestions for future Skin making in Poweramp1.) Support for skin makers to be able to use a wait screentransition screen. E.g. in between moving between different screens of PA like from player screen to EQ screen. Use of wait-like animated cursor icons etc2.) Support for imaging Overlays over the album art area (both in player and in widget). I think this would already exist. Basically I, if making skins in future, would like to be able to use transparent PNG images over the album art area to give that enclosed effect of a particular skin e.g. like this transparent case rotated CD case effect(click on image to enlarge)3.) Support for 3D skins. On the android homescreen LauncherPro app, there is 3D option when transition in between screens. Now what if this same 3D look could be fixed, I am talking about a future 3d PA skin that could have all the text,album art graphics in a fixed 3d state like this;a 3D button control skin;other 3D skin create-able examples;-a spinning CD Disc (animated fast-spinning) on a skin -how cool!!-a 3D opened box case skin w 3d placed text4.) Support for visual effects in skins e.g. Flash, Open GL, APNG (animated png) - might require additional low-level Android native coding.5.) Support for customizable and any-placeable metadata ID Tags texts (any tags). Basically it would be nice in special skins to be able to access tags such as composer or disc number and display them directly on the player - along with custom fonts, text size, color, text gradient effects. e.g. a jukebox skin or a totally less-graphical text based skin think of some of foobar2000s skins. ...for making a cassette tape skin like this and use this metadata info in a custom font for a skin;6.) Support for a touchdragg-able cursor for skinning (just like on Windows OS). Basically if I as a prospective skin maker wanted to make a Vista themed skin for PA, it would also be cool if there was an ability to have a cursor on finger movement around the screen and too cursor waiting. Just as an option.7.) Support for multi-display album art on a skin. Latest PA(Poweramp) versions already can access multiple album art that is embedded within tracks or is in folder of tracks which is excellent. So that access ability is there, but for skin makers it should be there too in order to make some rather interesting skins.e.g. a dual-album art skin (front+back cover at the same time) - KD Player (java j2me app);Or perhaps also front cover ON TOP of the back cover, like this;(if no back cover available then of course empty or something in its place)8.) Support for 1080p compatible skins (1920x1080p) as ever emerging Android devices, smartphones (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S2, tablets etc) have HDMI output function which means familybusiness users can output there whole Android onto a big screen. Maybe support for skin making with the use of scalable Vector formats like (.svg skins if Android supports that). 9) VLC has some awesome skins which I or original skin makers could convert to use on PA as a skin; http:www.videolan.orgvlcskins.php - Also KM Player, WinAmp, AIMP and Spider Player have awesome looking skins too. These are all desktop originated- Windows OS media players. But that should not deter anyone (with permission), or even original skin maker themselves, from converting these skins for use on PA(Poweramp) as a skin.10.) Consider adding API support for Flash (Adobe Flash) based skins which could even supplement some of the advanced previous skins ideasrequests made above 11.) Changing color of native Android OS UI color scheme of Black to White or another color. I am talking about for when most Android apps, such as PA itself, give user access to app settings. I know it is possible to change that to white such as this;Skin option in a meta file for this would be awesome too.12.) Poweramp could even have a special Theme Zone which would be its own little market app where users can download apply skins (internet required) right within PA itself. Think of the skin makersdesigners out there that would want to invest in PA a little more and make super high-end quality skins and may want to charge a fee for these skins too - thats where you could step in, Max, and become a paid mini-Android market yourself and it wont just be for skins, but for PA extensions, addons, DSP packs etc that users would make too etc :ugeek: 13.) Support for scrolling text (tags etc) in the skins and advanced text effects such as text dancing, text fade inout between tracks, text jump inout with speed settings per-configured by skin maker or maybe even user-configurable14.) Album art effects, ground-breaking effects ideas. Even a skin idea I have recently of Album art that would present itself as broken glass;15.) Ability to totally re-skin the EQ screen, volume knobs and everything in that screen.16.) Support for indicators. I mean text-based codes that a skin maker can use for hisher skin to show to users if say Equalizer is enabled or if Bass or Treble is on . This would be if I were to make a skin theme of a "Sub-Woofer" or "Hi-Fi player" and wanted a way of letting skin users know that EQ was enabled etc17.) Support for on-player visualizations (e.g. most notably Spectrum). I hope not too complex. I am mostly getting at a mini-Spectrum that could sit somewhere on the skin e.g. below album art. I have seen it in foobar2000s default GUI and some other media players and its not like a fully blown fullscreen visualization (as is already lined up in PAs TODO list). Active mini-Spectrum (or other Vizs) on a skin like on these skins;http:t2.pixhost.orgthumbs236169635682011-04-30163819.pngThese are all things to think of for the far future ahead in possibilities of skinning Poweramp. Thanks for reading.		30 April 2011 - 04:18 PM	haddy	[Thanks for the so detailed suggestions. PowerAMP v2.0 skin system wont bring very deep changed to the UI, depending on how deep skin dev will be wanting to dig, it can be: - either 1-to-1 replacement of graphic assets, font changes. This requires only graphical skills. - layout changes. This requires knowledge of Android layout XML. PowerAMP skins are standard android themes, its compiled layout xml + pngs. The difference from other apps with skin support - ability for 3rd party devs to create own skins for PowerAMP. Skin system is already implemented, but postponed until 2.0. Thanks!];[Haddy - you seem to know quite a bit about skinning. I notice that Poweramp has sort of a glow next to the album art that glows the same color as the predominant color of the album art. I wonder, is it possible to make a skin for Poweramp (when the new version is released) that will use this same effect to change the text, seek bar, etc...of the skin to match the album art?];
allow to play files in mntcifs	Id like to play files on my NAS server, mounted in mntcifsmusic with CIFS Manager, but I only can browse files under mntsdcard. It would be great if you allowed it. Thanks by advance.		05 May 2011 - 09:48 AM	jchortala	[Im unable to play files in mntsdcardmusic2 using cifs to my network share using Cifs Manager. Are you able to do this? You probably know this already but you can easily mount the network share using CIFS manager to your sdcard and browse to it there. Power amp will scan but no folders show up for me. I am able to get MortPlayer to work on the same share so I know the share is good.];
sound leveling	Not sure if this is the right term or if this has already been discussed but I have a lot of music that varies in its volume which forces me to constantly be fiddling with the sound. Is this something that your player can level out or do I need to find 3rd. part software to do this? Thanks!		04 April 2011 - 08:28 PM	tomorten	[This would be called Dynamic Range Compression or Compression Limiter I really would love such a feature so a plus 1 for me.];[There is already a technology called ReplayGain that is supported for doing this automatically. It scans your music and applies a tag which tells you how much to lower the volume so that every song is about the same dB value that you specify (generally 89dB). The player, however, needs to be able to read the tags and then apply the gain automatically. Several PC music players have support for scanning and then generating the correct tags.It would be great if Poweramp would implement this feature. Its the only one holding it back from being the single best app on my phone. Even without it, its still leagues ahead of everyone elseMore information here: http:www.replaygain.org];[I also post here to hold this thread alive. A auto gain feature or at least RG support would be awesome!];[A +1 from me. This would be a very nifty feature.];
folder scan - option for timed scan amp; select cifs subfolder	Hi - excellent app A couple of requests comments I use it on my tablet (Advent Vega) and access all my media via CIFS on my NAS box. Being NAS, it takes quite a while to rescan the CIFS folder and although my music collection doesnt change that often, Id like to have a timed scan automatically once a week. I can force a re-scan but this means a delay before using the app so Id like the option to have Poweramp initiate a background scan at a specified time (e.g. Friday 10am) Second request is about CIFS. I create my mount point using CIFSManager and it currently maps my mount point to the root of my NAS as that is all it is able to do. As a result, when I scan the folder, it scans ALL the folders on NAS (#092;#092;openshare#092;*) rather that just the folder where I have my music (#092;#092;openshare#092;Music#092;*). Is it possible to select a subfolder in Poweramp ? [MortPlayer has this capability but isnt as good in other areas] Thanks in advance.		06 May 2011 - 11:04 AM	MaxiP	
stop at startend of the listqueueselection	Hello, Ive just purchased the program and its great, but what realy annoys me is that - I pick f.ex. from library one artist and select "play all", first song of the list starts to play and when I click previous it jumps to some songs I never selected which are taken from whole library. I would realy appriciate if I can choose somewhere in settings, that when theres queue or I selected play all - I will only loop through files of the queue or my selection - think this is standart player behavior and I would realy like that option. I dont like making playlists or something - I usally select Artist and play whole discography or just one album. And I would like all gestures and buttons let me move only i my selected range ... For example if I have several albums from one Artist would jump from album to album and from song to song ... The selection would cycle if theres repeat all option, and do nothing on startend of the songs if it isnt. I hope you understand what I mean and such possibility would realy make your program 100 for me. Thanx Uli P.S.: I hope I didnt miss something in settings what is already there ...		05 May 2011 - 02:23 PM	uli	[Hi, when you select Play All, the first song from given list is played (Folder, album, artist, etc), pressing will move to last song of previous list (i.e. previous folder, album, artist, etc.). Thanks!];[Thats exactly what I dont like - because I would like to move only within my selection. Like when I select in my computer some folders and let them play - no other media files are available in music list movement. if it was possible to add some check box of such possibilty in settigns, I would be realy glad. But no big dig deal - as I said your program is great.Other thing is that makes next song and next artist ... how do I list through albums of selected artist? Im quite lost in possibilities of the program ...Thanx again];
disable whole id3 tags	hi there,ive just bought this app and kink of like this. but im missing one feature.disabling the tags.im not a music storing personal and have like only 800 songs, which are not-ill-tagged.about 600 are are sorted by folder tree with artist first and album later. rest 200 are songs from various artists and stored in a single MISC folder because its useless make whole artistalbum tree for only 1,2 files. these 200 files are named in artist - title.mp3by this, i can repeat every song from an artist or repeat only single album, or make a new playlist based on an artist. and ive never had needs of genre sorting system, so there are no use of id3 tags for me-it only makes me annoying. and here the problem happens.when i open MISC folder then i can see a whole mess. some of them are showing their tag based titles, and some of them are showing artist-title.mp3 with unknown artist. why i cannot see just filenames only and make the screen neat and tidy? my files are already sorted by artist, and album, and if they are not, that means all information i care are on the filenames(artist + title). would you please make an option disabling WHOLE id3 tagging system?		02 May 2011 - 04:45 PM	tee_em	[Hi, in PowerAMP v1.4 you can now force it to display filenames instead of title tags in FolderFolder playlists via Settings = Advanced Folder Options = Show Filenames Thanks!];
embedded .cue support?	Hello there! As this is my first post on this forum, I want to thank you for your hard work on Poweramp it simply the best droid music player now! Keep it this way. But do plans for embeded .cue support were droppped? I clearly remember that there was such line in TODOPlanned features thread, but now there is just - support for standalone .cue files(next release) and its what was done in 369, I suppose. All of my unsplitted .flacs .apes have .cue embedded in them and right now always plays as one big track and this is one Poweramp flaw that I can think of right now. Of course I can de-embed .cue from them and put it near, but, you know...		05 May 2011 - 09:51 AM	seigert	[Hi, embedded cue required scanning tag first for a track, this is currently not supported in PowerAMP, but will be in PowerAMP v2.x (as custom library requires full file scan). Thanks!];[Hi, embedded cue required scanning tag first for a track, this is currently not supported in PowerAMP, but will be in PowerAMP v2.x (as custom library requires full file scan). Thanks!];
smarter lock screen behaviour	It would be nice if Poweramp could know when the screen lock is disabled by third party app such as No Lock so that the lock screen widget only showed when the screen lock is active. Please consider adding this option.		05 May 2011 - 06:02 PM	Hatsune Miku	
cover flow like in the stock music player	I would like a cover flow option like seen in the stock Music Player for Artist and Albums Would be great if Albums used their Album artwork but Artist would download say band portrait or something along the lines but thats just a plus, Im more interested in Cover Flow for landscape mode to make it easier to select an album while driving, oh and maybe vocal commands for play, pause, listen to, would be awesome to make it more hands free.

track progress bar on lock screen widget	Although the and buttons are on the lock screen widgets, having the progress bar too would be perfect.

stop after folder and deactivate lockscreen	Heres my request for my missing features: 1. I would like to choose after playing a complete folder what the player has to do: a) stop and go back to the first track of this folder or stop and go to the first track of the next folder c) play the first track od this folder (normal repeat) - existing d) play the frst track of the next folder (current function) - existing 2. when Poweramp plays i would like to choose, if the player can deactivate the original lockscreen or not (current). so not like current power amp shows a widget - its better to decativate the lockscreen completely and show the whole player, not only a widget. Is it possible?		04 May 2011 - 07:10 AM	ChrisMarkos

add to queue request	Would it be possible to add an option that playing a selection automatically clears the queue, and adds the selection to the queue?

video support galaxy s feature support	Hi folks, the awesomeness of Poweramp is beyond discussion now. 1. I am ready to pay another 4.99 to be able to play videos in Poweramp. The important factor is to be able to play videos not natively supported by the handset - example DivX on HTC desire HD. Currently an SD DivX content is reeeeealy bad in HTC desire HD, and the available players are nothing but garbage. If you can pull this off the way that youve created current Poweramp, I am ready to pay another 4.99 2. Another features Id fancy having is the sound effects support in Samsung Galaxy S handsets, including virtual 5.1 surround sound support. Cheers and the best to you. Signature - an avid fan of your work.		01 May 2011 - 11:01 AM	nargar	
task bar	i dont know if this is possible but In the pull down android task bar if you could add forward, backward, and play pause buttons that would be phenomenal so that when using the phone speakers or headphones without a remote I wouldnt have to switch to power amp everyone I want to change the song.		05 April 2011 - 09:26 AM	Eskenig	[Thanks for the request. Its possible, but Android will close that status bar pull down window on each press, this makes no point in having or other navigation button there. Also, the size of the "block" is limited and fixed, i.e. buttons will take the space from song info. This is serious usability issue in Android below 3.0, this is why its not implemented by PowerAMP (or other apps). Honeycomb though allows some controls there.];[I see your point. What about perhaps using a double tap on the volume buttons for forward and backward? I can see how some people wouldnt like this but I think as an option itd be useful.];[Hey - I was looking to request the exact same thing for Honeycomb. Would be cool to be able to popup the Poweramp taskbar and navigateplaypause songs. Is this planned for a future release?

amazon	Will Power Amp be available on amazon anytime soon?		25 April 2011 - 05:51 PM	sonicmike	[Not sure, as: - amazon doesnt give any visible benefits, currently, for dev - it requires completely different build as they are not compatible in licensing with Market - it adds more fragmentation to android (as app store, and for dev, as additional version to track) But if they, for example, add more countries, add more payment methods,or do anything that will give reason to all the work needed to adapter app for them - its possible.

pauseplay previousnext music track on notification bar	Hello there, I just came across a pretty good idea. I love the player and I dont think it could be any better. Its the best on android! I was just thinking that it would bbe pretty cool to have the play, pause, previous track and next track button on the notification bar along with the song whenever u pull down the notification bar. Its quick and very convient and best of all, new to everyone else. So Poweramp would be the first player on android to have the feature. But I hope you like my idea and it brings u more fortune in the success of the music player Sincerely Anthony Asher		27 April 2011 - 03:30 AM	AnthonyAsher	[Hi, thanks for the request. The pull down notification "drawer" closes it self on any click in app notification rectangle.

hide artistalbum	Hey there, Ill make this quick. I found that I have quite a few artists with only one song in my library. I cant be the only one, so I have a feeling others are also bothered by scrolling through a library populated heavily by single song artists to get to artists that the user would actually use the sorting feature to find. Basically, I dont think anyone goes through the sort by artist section to find one song. Could there be a way to hide certain artists, or even albums, from that view to reduce the clutter, but keep the song? The song would probably only be played through the All Songs listing anyway. Maybe even a function that automatically hides an artist or album if it doesnt reach a lower limit of X songs? Im sorry if Im not clear enough, its a little hard to explain it.		24 April 2011 - 04:15 PM	sanamkan	
sort albums by artist, then year, and auto-advance	Hey, this might be somewhat of a niche feature, but Id like to see albums sorted by artist, then year in the Library view. 3 (cubed) does this, and I thought it was a pretty neat idea, especially combined with auto-advance. Sorting music this way allows you to listen to an artists discography in chronological order, if youre in the mood to just listen to an entire artists discography. If this is implemented, Id probably pay any price for this app. Well, maybe not 20+, but it would still be a feature that Id love. Thanks for reading.		12 November 2010 - 12:11 AM	raycosm	[Hi, I just bought Poweramp and Im really happy with this great music app. But I miss the same feature as raycosm.

tweet current track	Hi guys, I really like that app and its the best one out there but Im still missing one function: tweet current song by pressing that button Poweramp should send a tweet like "#nowplaying Interpret - Title" from the users Twitter account.

don#39;t list top level folder	Hi, I have a suggestion for a change in Poweramp folder hierarchy. When you check one or more music folders in the respective menu all of these folders are displayed as top level folders in the folders tab hierarchy. This probably feels OK when you use multiple folders however many users including me only use a single top level folder for storing their music. In this scenario only on top level folder is displayed and it becomes an unnecessary nuisance to navigate into this folder before you can see the actual list of albums in that folder. Could you please add the option NOT to display the top level folder(s) in the folders hierarchy and only show the sub-folders? Thanks Petr		20 April 2011 - 11:09 AM	ego42	
playlist shortcut support	This is something I just realized is missing. With both the stock music player and Mixzing you can create home screen shortcuts to playlists. This is an extremely useful feature to quickly start playing a particular playlist. Hopefully this sort of support can be added.

hide shuffle button and repeat button	Hi, First of all, this is the best player for Sony Xperia X10. Second: sometimes when I click on the buttons next prev, accidentally I click on shuffle repeat. There are a way to disable these buttons as I do with the delete button? Thanks and best regards, Toninho.		17 April 2011 - 07:09 PM	toninhofwi	[Hi, thanks for the feedback and request.

longer seek bar (at least in landscape mode)	The ability to seek through a song quite useful when there are parts you likedont like, but especially for things like audio books, recorded lectures, etc. The seek bars accuracy as of now is not very good, mostly because its so short and fixed to one length. The longer the audio track, the harder it is to seek to a desired location accurately. It would be helpful if there were an option to extend the seek bars length, at least in landscape mode. But what would REALLY be cool, is if the seek bar could do the following: -zoomable, that is, the ability to use multitouch to zoom in or pinch to zoom out -scrollable, after zooming in, the ability to swipe it back or forth -able to select a discrete time index. Maybe double-tap and hold the seek bar to show a toast of the time index thats being touched, then sliding your finger back or forward will move through the seek bar as the toast updates the time index. When you let go, playback is moved to that time index. If the seek bar happens to be zoomed-in, then sliding your finger back or forward will auto-scroll the seek bar. The speed at which it auto-scrolls would be determined by how far left or right your finger is. -able to save bookmarks within individual tracks. Unlimited startstop marks. For example: Say my song is 4 minutes long, and I want to always skip the 3rd minute. I would set a Start-marker at 0:00:00, a stop-marker at 0:02:00, and another start-marker at 0:03:00. Anything from a start-marker to a stop-marker (or EOF) would play, anything from a stop-marker to a start-marker (or EOF) would be skipped. You could put as many startstops in a track as you want. Also, the option to transition from a stop to the next start with a subtle "gradient effect" would make it sound more natural, instead of an abrupt change in audio. -the option to have a vertical seek bar. That way the seek bar could be as long as possible when in portrait mode. I know thats a tall order. But holy cow that would be SOOOOOOO COOL!!		07 April 2011 - 04:27 PM	pleonasm	[Thanks for the detailed request. PowerAMP will have support for customdownloadable skins very soon and Im planning to add few skins with a bit modified layout with full-width seekbar. Btw, the wider seekbar is available in Playlists in landscape mode. As for other options, some of them are possible, like going to discrete time index, the problem here is easy to use UI without additional buttons.];[ah thanks for letting us know about the longer seek bar in play lists in landscape mode. one thing I thought about is if you press and hold on seek bar, have it open up a second seek bar above it that is zoomed in that gives you finer control. kind of like a pop-up. that was the first action I tried to elicit since it seems logical.];[Thanks for posting this in such a detailed manner. I love this app but when listening to podcasts, I sometimes find myself wanting to rewind by a minute or less bc I missed something and the seek bar in its current iteration does not facilitate this very well, the sliding after a long press not granular enough to be able to seek in 1 minute increments. Alternatively, tapping on the seek bar is a crap shoot as to where the current playing position will end up at. I look forward to these enhancements!];
disable other apps from playing audio notifications	Hi, Here is my problem: Im listening to some tunes while driving and somebody on GTalk starts talking to me. My song continually gets interrupted by the notification sound. Is there any way to add an option to not allow other apps to play notifications (with exception made to the dialer obviously)? I already have the pause on short audio focus change set, but the perfect scenario is to not have any interruption at all. Thanks, Mike		15 April 2011 - 06:15 PM	elgorbo	
while using car dock	Would it be possible that when using the car dock and the screen is off, long holding the volume up key starts over and volume down key skips current track and using the camera shutter button pauses playback? This would be great because i dont always keep my screen on while driving and the phone is in the dock, and its sometimes hard to turn the screen ON, unlock it, draw my unlock pattern and then use a gesture to skip music.		09 April 2011 - 11:57 AM	bgrade	[Good idea. I love PA, but I must admit its not vehicle-friendly at all. Not yet, anyway... But the camera button-pause wouldnt work for me. No camera button on the Atrix. Maybe add a configuration page where you can assign any button to any function, along with the option of specifying shortlongdoubletriple press for the button. That way, people could make it work however they want with whatever buttons they happen to have available to them. I see how this could be dangerous (ie. if a user assigns the power button to pauseunpause, happens to be in a meeting taking notes, then presses power button to put his phone to sleep, and it starts blasting out Spice Girls or something embarrassing). But you could put a big fat disclaimer, or allow the user to specify "only respond to button press when PA has focus". Idunno. But making a more car-friendly interface for it would be awesome. Maybe it could switch to that interface automatically when docked, like the default player does. Thats "what I want, what I really really want."];[yes, so max is there any chance of this happening?];
musepack (mpc) support	Hi Poweramp developers,first of all, my congratulations for making such a great product! (As a matter of fact, I am a developer myself.)I am opening this thread to ask you to please add support for Musepack (MPC) files in Poweramp. Musepack is a very efficient audio CODEC, not only in terms of quality vs filesize but also in terms of encodingdecoding speed and memory footprint. In the official site http:www.musepack.net it is possible to download the source code, which is LGPL licensed. You may would also like to take a look at "DeaDBeeF Free Plugins Pack" on Android Market.Best regards,Adriano		21 March 2011 - 03:15 AM	audiosound	[Thanks for the request.

show filenames in folder view	It would be nice if the actual filenames could be seen in folder filelists and folder playlists. I find it a tiny bit irritating to not be able to see the filename when files are sorted by filenames. It would be extra great, if Poweramp supported renaming files right in the player interface. I wouldnt object if the "ringtone" button that is part of the popup which appears when you long tap a song in the playlist was replaced with a "rename" button, but the info popup could host a "rename" button as well.		28 November 2010 - 09:16 PM	ohnoanotheraccount	[Thanks for the request.

option to toggle off notification sound music interruption?	Maxmpz,I see that you already commented on this idea at least once in the past, such as this post:But what Im wondering is whether or not itd be possible for you to implement a hack of sorts to allow this to be toggled off—some way to trick the OS into behaving differently. Ive read that the other major smartphone operating systems merely fade the music low in volume during a notification, while Androids 2-second mute is quite abrupt to the listener. I dont expect something as elegant as a volume fade to be easily implemented, but if notifications could be played simultaneously with music, even at the same volume, I think a lot of users would be pleased. It sure doesnt seem like Google will be addressing this in the OS any time soon: http:code.google.c...detail?id=5012Any thoughts? Keep up the awesome work! :mrgreen: Jon		11 February 2011 - 12:29 AM	CapitalQ	[Yes, there are requests like this and Im going to put this into next update.

I.e. if song S is in album A, if you assign preset to album A, S gets assignment which is used even if you play song S from playlist P. - assign eq to category.

shuffled playlist	Cant see this in the current features to do list, but apologies if it is there. Recently started using this rather than PocketPlayer on win6.5, which was excellent. The feature I miss most is being able to create a playlist of my entire collection and then shuffle that list so that each song would only play once throughout playing through that list. It would then remember your position from day to day. Poweramp appears to just do a basic shuffle where the list is not maintained and various events seem to rebuild it. Just needs a shuffle list function to apply to the playlist and then allow you to save that revised list in the new order.		22 March 2011 - 12:04 PM	BT52	[You can either just press SHUFFLE on main screen to get to Shuffle all mode (this is the first mode activated by this button) - it will shuffle your whole folders or library collection this way. There is no limited history or anything like that. Instead WHOLE list is loaded and items randomly reordered. The loading whole list doesnt hurt memory as its only 4-8 bytes per song (only IDs loaded). Or you can also create playlist and either hit SHUFFLE until Shuffle playlist mode or long press on playlist and select Shuffle All button to get that playlist shuffled. PowerAMP will reshuffle on: - other list (albumartistplaylistfolderetc) selected - sd cardfolders rescanned - PowerAMP process killed by some other event Thanks!];[Sorry, will this allow me to create a playlist of 800 songs say, play 20 of them shuffled, then turn the phone off and on and it will continue to play the rest of the shuffled playlist without revisiting the previously played 20 songs? Just to clarify, its the ability to shuffle a playlist that I am after (so I can see the shuffled playlist order as well), not the ability to play a playlist in shuffle-mode.];[PowerAMP will keep shuffled list while its process is alive, i.e. it wont survive phone reboot or task killer. Thanks!];[Thats what I thought. Was a bit confused in the playlist view when I pressed menu-shuffle and saw that the playlist remained in its original order. Hence this being a feature request to allow a playlist to be reordered. Either manually or with a shuffle command. Cant be hard to simply reorder the references in a playlist and save it. PocketPlayer is a good example for this. Would then give the ability to randomly play through a large music library over a period of several daysweeks without repetitions. Ah, sorry, have only just noticed that there are other requests for this already submitted in the forum (also mentioning PocketPlayer I see).];[Thanks, interesting idea.];

equalizer editing	hi, i do not know how other people edit their equalizer but my phone has low resolution, and i can not be precise in my editing. it would be nice to have an alternative to sliding the bands of the eq, or the knobs for bass an trebble, for finer tuning. say long pressing the frequency under a slider in the eq opens up a menu where i can write the amplification value (in or db - someting like +1.8db or -32), and a nice percentage value under the bass and trebble knobs the follows the same principle. looking forward to the answer!		21 February 2011 - 01:40 PM	misha0209	[Hi, you can switch equ bands to +-6dB range via advanced tweaks in PowerAMP Setting - this will allow finer tuning. You can press below or above the equ knob to change band value by -+ 10.

native last.fm scrobble support	Hi there,I really love Poweramp but what really bothers me is that it only has support for SLS and Scrobble Droid. I know that the official Last.fm app can scrobble song with these notificationsbroadcasts but they are really buggy. E.g. songs are scrobbled if you listened only 10 seconds of them contrary to the 50 or 4 minutes you need with the offical app and every player on the pc. Songs also get scrobble 2 times if you pause them and unpause them after a few minutes. Since it should be pretty simple to implement the broadcasts for the official Last.fm app I would be more than happy if you could implement them.Infos for the broadcasts: https:github.comc... ... -interface		04 February 2011 - 04:34 PM	Jeddix	[Thanks for the request.];[Thanks for implementing .];[Hi there, today I finally had time to test this and it is still a little bit buggy .

general question abt the sound quality	Hi everyone. I have been checking out other android music players in the market and noticed some Poweramp users switched to mixzing becus of sound quality issue.(according to the user comments) honestly, i ve tried mixzing myself but couldnt tell much difference. Maybe mixzing provides slightly better sound quality, but how is it possible? both Poweramp and mixzing have eq functions but what would make some ppl move from this app to that one with such aweful interface design?(strictly biased honest personal opinion btw.) So my question is, is there a way for A music player to enhence sound quality of the music output without using eq function?? Maybe bunch of presets or auto-adjusting function would do the job? But then it sounded like they were referring to the actual ability of the music player to extract sound more effectively. (Just like cowon mp3 player can produce far better sound quality than iriver or ipod) so it would be much appreciated if someone can tell me the factors that contribute to the android phone music player#39;s ability to improve the actual sound quality. P.s: not trying to diss other apps. i just want to know what they r claiming is viable.		01 March 2011 - 07:26 PM	ElNAth	[For some users quality == loudness.

bunch of feature requests	hi, i figured i make a post with all the features i would like in Poweramp, so here goes: 1) different control for Tone knobs (something that allows me to see numbers like xx, or finer controll, i wand to go as high as possible without distortion, so knowing that the value for bass is 52 would be helpfull) 2) something that allows me to backup Poweramp settings (hate reconfiguring, and remaking all eq presets after each ROM update, especially the tone knobs) 3) ability to disable fade between tracks 4) ability to disable fade animation of album art 5) ability to change text and background colour in lower part of screen (song name , artist, album, is currently blueish colour, on a blueish background, since i do not have LED display, i can not read while outside) to white on black, or black on white 6) same as number 5 but for folder and library view (here background is black, it would be more useful if text wore white) that#39;s about it... what do you think?		30 March 2011 - 04:12 PM	misha0209

lockscreen player integration in goto or others	Hey There Poweramp man!!!1st of all........seriously sweet app.....love it...nothing comes close But I gotta ask 1 small (or maybe big thing) I really like the GOTO lockscreen app, makes life easy when screen is locked....and I really love Poweramp, unfortunately you can#39;t use both together.....I asked the GOTO if they can integrate your app into theirs and they said they need an API....Here is a link to exactly what they said to someone else http:getsatisfacti... ... ockscreen (except he was using winamp, sigh, unlucky for him )anyways, any chance you can team up with the GOTO team and make an awesome hybrid lockscreenmusic player controller thing..... that would rock my world!!! and hopefully plenty of other peoples!!!

suggestion for sorting songs	I used many players for android, no one is as powerful as Poweramp. But I think it will be more convenient if it has some features of sorting . The songs in the playlist created by users or automatically by the players(such as highest ranked, most played, last played, etc) should be able to sorted by track name, album, artist, added date(the date that the song is added to library), played times, etc. Sorting manually as before is also needed. In this case, having the features of rating(I know it is in progress), its corresponding auto playlist"higest ranked", counting played times and its corresponding playlist "most played"(the entries should have a limit,e.g.30) are required . Those features could be implemented by the custom tag of "rating" and "playcounter", for example. PS: I know the features of lyrics is in progress, but I also has a suggestion: supporting to display the lyrics in "lyrics" tag of the song file(embedded lyrics).Also, if in there is a colum bar of alphabet displayed at the right side of list menu, it will be more convienent to allocate a song. Thanks		25 March 2011 - 09:12 AM	deathell	
linking	Hi, Many of tracks on my playlist, are divided into parts (for example "Shine on you crazy diamond" by Pink Floyd). When i use shuffle mode, it sometimes play random part of the song, which makes listening to it a bit weird. Is there any posibility of adding linking feature? You would link parts of the song together, that would make Poweramp play the whole song instead of just one part of it. Example: it shuffles into Part 2 (which is linked with part three, and one [where Part 1 is marked as the starting one]), checks if the song is linked with anything, then follows the sequence from part 1-3, and returns to normal shuffling order. Sorry if I sound unclear, or if there is some other way to do this (excluding manually merging parts of the song together). Regards		24 March 2011 - 01:56 PM	wiped	
volume keys	hi, 3rd time i am repostng this, and have yet to recieve a reply. wondering if you could implement something in settings that allows me to lock the physical volume keys (volume rocker) of the device when the screen is locked (like a little checkbox under lock screen that says disable volume keys when screen is locked). i keep accidentally changing the volume while phone is in pocket, or when i take it out put it in my pocket. also can you add an option to disable song fade inout, and album art fade inout? Thanks!		16 March 2011 - 12:21 PM	misha0209	[(stock) Android doesn#39;t send volume key presses to background apps or when screen is off. So answer is no.

replay gain	hi, read that you want to implement replay gain in Poweramp. good stuff! if you do replay gain, then i have a request. could you implement preamp the way it is done in foobar2000? what i really would like is to have the processing option available for replay gain in foobar, specifically the "apply gain, and prevent clipping according to peak" mode. ideally this should be implemented before the eq processing, so you can amplify the input as much as possible without distortion before eq. then a limiter or preferably a compressor built into the eq, and distortions are a thing of the past, no? what do you think? is it worth a go? ps: your thoughts on my last post: viewtopic.php?f=3t=1223		12 March 2011 - 07:39 PM	misha0209	[Hi, thanks for request. While limiter is planned, a compressor is not (it will change sound and is not needed). Note that like 95 of tracks are normalized and any equalizer frequency band amplification requires negative preamp to avoid the clipping.];[Hi, i see, but right now i have preamp at max + eq amplification in order to get decent sound level on the street. so, will you try to implement the apply gain and prevent clipping according to peak option like in foobar? that is what i#39;m really hoping for. i know compressor changes sound and is not liked by audiophiles but it helps in getting perceptually #39;#39;louder" output. the core of the problem is that the player is just quieter than say the stock player with some eq presets on. i#39;m just trying to make Poweramp as loud as possible on my device without distortion. figured bass compression would help to get a phat bass, while the overall song still being loud. thanks!];[Hi, is the feature "auto preamp for equalizertone (i.e. sound level limiter)" actually the replay gain support?];
enqueue feature	Please add en-queue feature.It is a very basic feature and right now only Winamp for android is providing it.		26 February 2011 - 06:36 PM	phoenixrisen	[Thanks for the request. Currently you can remove tracks from the queue via standard PowerAMP per-song context menu, or whole queue can be cleared via main menu.];[Hello and big thanks for this great app. I bought Poweramp several weeks ago and I#39;m really happy with it, but theres one more thing I would greatly appreciate (and I#39;m sure it#39;s not only me). I believe phoenixrisen is not refering to the possibility of deleting tracks from queue, but rather to add files to "now playing" list like it can be done in Winamp. For example if I#39;m listening to an album(folderplaylist) and I want to add more tracks(albumsfoldersplaylists) at the end of the currently played list, there is no (easy) way to do it, because current queue function adds the files right after current track (+ it#39;s saved so I have to manualy clear it after I#39;m done listening). Would it be possible to add feature similar to above mentioned Winamp#39;s enqueue = basicaly just start playing what I want after current albumfolderplaylistwhatever finishes + if I change my mind few songs later and want to listen to something completely different, don#39;t save it anywhere? That would made your app just perfect in my eyes Thanks again and keep up the good work!];[PowerAMP doesn#39;t have special now playing list. It plays lists (foldersalbumsartistsall songsplaylistsetc) directly without intermediate playlist. Though, user created playlist or queue - both are direct replacement of "now playing", if you used to this approach. Thanks!];[Thank you for the quick response.

manage current playing	Hi, here#39;s a new request:I saw that we have access to the current playing list, but only to play further songs, no managing options seem available. For me, it will be usefull to make this list as a temporary playlist, so you can add a songalbumartist from the library in the current playing playlist. For exemple, when you long press a song, you have + playlist as usual, and play now (will play immediatly, current playing song will be back after the one inserted), play next (will play after the current playing song) and play end (songs will be played after the last song of the playing list).I#39;m not sure that it#39;s clear, but you can have a look on Lithium player, it is also a great player, the one I was using.Thanks		03 November 2010 - 08:42 AM	mephisto	[Actually, the ability to manage ANY playlist would be helpful. Basically, more powerful management features (move items up and down the list, select multiple items to delete from a playlist or add to a playlist, etc). Also, sorting options would be useful (sort by artist, title, etc). These are common features in desktop players, and would easily woo people away from other players with these kinds of features (Coreplayer comes to mind).];[+1 This is the no1 new feature for me.];[Thanks for the request! PowerAMP currently focused on Folder Playing, support for Library and Playlists will be improved in next versions, still it will be kept as simple as possible (there won#39;t be 10+ buttons to add to various playlists as in other players). PowerAMP playlists are live, i.e. if you#39;re playing giving playlist, you are free to add songs to it and they will be peeked up automatically without the need to reload playlist as in other players. This way ADD TO PL actually works as enqueue to playlist, when the playlist is currently played. Current playlist entry seems to be useful though - either via additional top item in select playlists dialog, or via some icon for current playlist in that dialog. Also, standard android os player uses conception of "current list" which always resides in memory and it contains the songs you previously selected. (This approach copied by many other players, which just use modified sources of standard player in this department). If you select single song, current list will contain only this song, for example. PowerAMP doesn#39;t follow this approach. Instead it actually plays the selection made by user, there is no intermediate "current list". If you select single song, it will continue to next song in the list, etc. This approach better fits Folder mode, it takes less memory, it can be optimized better, shuffle history can be non-limited length (it#39;s limited in other players), and, I think, it#39;s less confusing and more usable.];[But if we#39;re not listening to a playlist but an album, we can not enqueue an other song we want to listen without stoping lecture. This is for me different from playlist as they exist yet in Poweramp. In Lithium, it seems to be very simple: long press on a songalbum open a pop-up menu with "play now", play next#39;, "play last", "add to playlist", "edit" and "delete". I don#39;t know if it will fit with your layout, or the application architecture, but it will be great. Otherwise we have to create a "playing" playlist, and erase it every time... A little bit annoying when you#39;ve reach such a quality with the others features.Thanks];[I understand you concern. It#39;s possible to add "play this next" action (PowerAMP will move to that song after current one finishes), but adding many songs to queue without current playlist will require "current list" approach. It may be possible to implement some virtual queue though, I will think about this more. Thanks anyway!];[thanks With all the requests on this forum, I can#39;t wait for the next update . Good work!];[Next update will be "minor" update, i.e. bug fixes and small tweaks. Major update is v.2.0 which will have more new features, but it#39;s not coming sooner than like in a month.];[I agree with the simple "enqueue to active playlist" philosophy. I was just wondering if it#39;s possible to edit playlists. Moving items up and down and selecting multiple files to addremove are important when making a playlist. Currently we have to add items one by one, and we can#39;t rearrange the playlist once made. We have to start from scratch if we want to play one song or one folder before the others, for example.];[An enqueue option similar to WinAmp#39;s, that is, when you play a song outside of a playlist and want to queue up several songs without creating a playlist, but rather a song queue, would be a great feature addition and put it over the top. Once you add the ability to enqueue, I#39;m sold.];[+1 on this feature request. Even if the playlists are live, it still would require user to maintain a currently playing playlist. Please give us a "Now Playing" playlist and a long-tap on list item will give us option to either add to a playlist or Now-Playing along with other options. I believe it is more natural way of playing music for users also.];[+1 on this as well. Its not about playlists, just about knowing what album (or two) I want to listen to next. Btw, Poweramp is absolutely brilliant. Android really needed a music player this good. Iphone has Itunes, and both PalmOS and WinMo have Pocket Tunes - Android seriously needed Poweramp. Thanks!];[I support this request as well. It#39;s the one differentiating feature that keeps me using WinAmp over Poweramp. I couldn#39;t care less about playlists, all I want to do is enqueue multiple albums, exactly like WinAmp lets you do. My typical use is, I find and album I want to listen to, click play, find additional 2-3 albums and enqueue them up so they will play in order, uninterrupted. I don#39;t want to create playlists for this.];[+ 1 I agree its the natural way of listening music... You go hanging around your library, finding songs you want to listen to... Changing the order... and adding to and existing playlist];[YES PLEASE! This is my biggest gripe with Poweramp too. I#39;m afraid you#39;re reinventing a perfectly good wheel here maxmpz ( viewtopic.php?f=3t=72hilit=queuesid=0c9d07d720b28cbd2fae7a9c036221b6#p205 ) and the invention seems to be actually "more confusing and less usable". What I and apparently many (most ?) other users need is really just a simple plain old WinAmp style playqueue to which you may add files from a) folder view, library view and c) playlists (I don#39;t personally care much about c) or even for that matter but I understand others may). The whole concept of "live playlists" is just strange and I end up having just one folder playlist (which I naturally call "folder playqueue") to which I add single songs and whole folders to be played. It is obviously possible to live with that but it is extremely cumbersome and the fact that the playing order cannot be manipulated and songs can only be added from the folder view and not the library view only adds salt to the wound. Please reconsider your approach and consider adding the following features which are repeated in many posts in this thread: 1) simple central WinAmp (PC) style playqueue instead of "live playlists", 2) play order manipulation in the playqueue (PlayerPro does that pretty well), 3) multiple item operations in the playqueue (remove from playque, move within playqueue). Am I forgetting anything? Anyway thanks a lot for a great player, the design and some of the functionality are unparalleled on Android, it#39;s really awesome (apart from the a-bit-too-original approach to playlistsplayqueue)! Petr];[I think for folders everyone gets what is pretty expected - sequential or random(shuffle) playing of files. For the library - yes, it#39;s a bit different from stock player, as it applies the same approach as for folders - sequential playing of songs from the list without creating intermediate virtual current playing list. Queue support will make it very similar to virtual current playlist - and it will also work for folders. Also, there will be option not to stop after queue ends, but to return to the last position in the latest played list and continue.];[OK, we#39;ll see. And thanks a lot for the great support, this is again something you don#39;t see every day.];[If queue (a stack of songs to be played and after that continue to play normally) feature is implemented - im buying this player:) really nr.1 thats missing for me.];[+1 for queuing songs. I wanted to add a song to the dynamic queue yesterday and was surprised that a player with so many features didn#39;t support it. I have Amarok on my desktop PC and I use its queuing ability all the time. Would be really nice if we would see this in Poweramp soon.];[+1 on this one. I am still using Winamp on my Desire (2.2), even though I really like the bass boosted sound of Poweramp and the blue look better. The only thing that keeps me clinging on to Winamp is that I also like to "play DJ" for myself when I#39;m on the road. While listening to a song I browse through the library and find songs I enqueue to be played next. Winamp then also allows you to change the order of the "now playing queue" by dragging the songs up and down. To be honest, that#39;s a really nice feature... :ugeek: Today I decided to install the Poweramp trial again to see if such a feature has now been added. I#39;m happy to see that there might be something coming and hereby wanted to add my voice to the (minor) choir Good luck developing and you#39;ll definitely have my cash as soon as the queuing is happening];[+1I#39;m also showing my support for this request. Creating a playlist just to manage a list of songs I don#39;t necessarily want to save seems wrong. It needs to be similar (if not identical) to Winamp#39;s enqueue feature. My preferred music player on the desktop (http:banshee.fm), has this feature. Also, I used it in Winamp when I was on Windows heavily.If and when this is implemented, I#39;ll be buying this player.Thanks for taking the time to create Poweramp. Other developers need to realize that a good UI is important.P.S. You#39;re name is awesome!];[Cubed has my favorite implementation of current playing list, and I#39;ve never seen it implemented anywhere else. I#39;m probably going to do a bad job explaining it, but it goes somewhat like this:[*:1nqalspy]Clicking "Play Now" on a song clears the queue and makes it the only song in the queue.[*:1nqalspy]If there are no other songs in the queue, then the player will just play songs straight through an album, and advance to the next album when done. The currently playing song is the only song in the queue, the song before it is always removed from the queue after playing.[*:1nqalspy]If a song is added to the queue, then the player will advance to that song after the currently playing song. The original song is removed from the queue after it is finished.[*:1nqalspy]The player always plays straight through an album, unless there are songs in the queue.Essentially, the player would always play music non-stop. If the queueplaylist ends, then the player would player the rest of the album, picking up from the last song in the queue. It made it easy for me to queue music for car rides without having to mess with the player after the end of a playlist.];[I agree. Cubed does a great job with the cue. Poweramp is far superior in everything else! When that queue is added its gonna be awesome!];[Thanks for description. I wonder how it manage (backward) action if songs are removed from queues. PowerAMP planned queue system is very similar, but songs don#39;t disappear from queue, instead, they are kept there for navigation until all songs are played from the queue, after that PowerAMP returns to the latest position anywhere in the lists it was previously, before queue was started.];[Bump.

It#39;s similar to what dogfish comments on in another thread:Just to explain from my perspective: My life with Poweramp revolves around the queue function :ugeek: Even if I want to hear a whole cd, I simply add it to the queue (and can now mix it up with what#39;s already there ). This way I#39;m in control of what I hear.However, after my queue runs out, Poweramp "decides" for me to automatically advancing to....the same song every single time... :| I believe it#39;s the first song of my folder structure or something. Needless to say, I#39;m pretty sick of hearing the same song starting to play after the queue is done...hehe.Is there a way to impliment a feature to simply get "end of playing queue" after the queue is done and no auto-advancing whatsoever. I#39;d love to hear silence after my queue finishes! :-DI hope this makes sense...Thanks again for the great app!!];[PowerAMP should return back to where it was last time.

itunes song metadata (last play timestamp, rating, etc)	Hello First let me say that I have bought this wonderful application, it does just all I need, beautiful, equalizer, perfect random mechanism.

I have searched through the list of features request and did not find it : Is there a technicall possibiliy (and will, and no legal issues lol) to add support for the "iTunes metadata" (aka song attributes) such as : - count on number of time the file was played (readwrite) - last play timestamp (readwrite) - volume normalising (read) - 0-5 stars ratings (readwrite) - etc I would love this to work so that I could sync back to itunes and make sure my dynamic list on itunes are updated (as per example I have a dynamic playlist that plays only song that were never played before or not played in the last month, etc...) P.S : now that I typed my request, I start to realise that even if you do add this, I am not sure how to sync back to itunes.... ;o) (I can sync from itunes into my phone, but via a 3rd teer application (HTCsync) which is not snycing both ways... so well...

shuffle-mode	Hello,is there any way to use PA in shuffle-mode and have a real shuffle? I have about 2.000 Songs on my Phone and PA works about 8 - 12 hours per day but it feels like some radio-stations. PA plays a random series of my music but in a short time it play the same songs.I was using Pocketmusic Player before on my Windows Mobile Phone and this player was playing all songs in shuffle until it played ALL songs and there was no double or repeat of any. I could also rearrenge all songs randomly in a playlist there.Useful would be a playlist-function, where I can rearrange the songs in a playlist randomly with a click (from a menu or a button).At all I am missing a playlist-view unattached of the folder or library view.Thank you for this phantastic play and your work!Gunther		05 March 2011 - 10:56 AM	gufo	[Please use search in this forum to find out how PowerAMP shuffles songs (I will add this to FAQ as well).

Thanks!];[Okay, I was searching for Threads, but not one can help me.And I have to contradict. The shuffle-Mode does not play all Songs in random arrangement until ALL Songs are played. To say there are simply repeatings is an understatement. I noted 3 or more of them and all Songs are only one time in the Folder- oder Librarylist.This is an very short example, how it works:-Title 500,-Title 2,-Title 1700,-Title 1200,-Title 2,-Title 4-Title 199,-Title 1200,-Title 1201,-Title 1950,-Title 2,-Title 400and so on. Maybe it plays all Songs at all, but there are innumerable Repetitions and it nerves. Approximately all 15 - 20 minutes I have to press the "Next" button.If I could rearrange a Playlist randomly, I would never have this problem again.That#39;s why I think it would be better to have a Playlist-Feature, where I can edit and sort all entries manuelly or with some tipps.If PA already have this feature (or something similar) please let me know and please tell me how and where, because I didn#39;t seen it.Thank you.Gunther];[Just go to current played list when duplication is played and remember it relative position, then navigate back until the same song and check it position. Most probably these will be different entries in the list. Current PowerAMP approach to shuffling excludes possibility of duplications from the shuffling itself. Still, if something forces PowerAMP to reload list, the list will be reshuffled. It can be anything (other apps, e.g. syncing apps) generating media rescan events. Reshuffled list can be detected by going back with - you#39;ll get "start of song list" early as shuffle history is cleared by reshuffling. Thanks!];

widget	first off i love this app : the only things I#39;m missing ist replaygain support, but i read it#39;s on the to do list allready a 1x1 widget that just shows the album art, if you hit it it will open PA a 2x1 widget Album Art + Playpause button thanks for the great work, keep it up		12 March 2011 - 11:53 AM	meowmoo	
feature request move copy now playing song to folder	So far power amp is coming along nicely. Can you add ability to move or copy the now playing song to another folder, like how adding to a playlist works but instead move or copy the actual mp3 to a folder. This will help tremendously with organizing music on our devices. Also adding support to view and modify the id3 tag rating would be very useful. I will recommend power amp to my fellow android users. Thanks! Mike		09 March 2011 - 10:23 PM	mam2169	[Currently you can add from playlists to other playlists, including current playlist, the next PowerAMP release adds drag-n-drop reordering. Putting some File Manager functionality into Folders is a viable idea, I will think about adding it in most unobstructive way (I don#39;t want it to be complicated). Thanks!];
more than one equalizer preset on the same output.	Hi. I apologize for my poor English and if this question has already been made. First, congratulations for the great application, it was my first purchase on the market from the early versions and since then has only improved I greatly appreciate the equalizer presets and I like to have more than one on the same input. I make an example: I use Poweramp both with headphones, and in car through the aux connector and the settings have to be be different in the two cases, even if the input is always the 3.5" jack. Perhaps the application could simply open a popup (if it encounters more than one preset on the same input) which provides a rapid choice (in this case headphones or car). I believe that mine is a fairly common scenario that could be appreciated by many, even if it is not actualy a major drawback to manually change the preset Thank you for your attention, I hope in this small addition and look forward to more themes (very much appreciated) and crossfader (I#39;ve read that the this two are already planned).		10 March 2011 - 02:29 AM	Andrea	[Thanks for the feedback and request. Unfortunately, for 3.5 connection, any headsetother device is the same for hardwareos and PowerAMP - there is no way to distinguish between them. BT headsets can be actually distinguished this way, but not wired headsets. The popup for preset on wired headset connection is not better than just quick preset selection. Thanks!];
next song jump	Poweramp is super and I can#39;t wait for the next update (fully paid up in the meantime). Is it possible to display the next queued song on the main screen with a button to skip if not wanted? Maybe as an alternative to the track location string (I have an HTC Wildfire and screen space is at a premium so would need some thought about the best way to show)? Similar functionality to the Queek music player which although very buggy is very useful if you#39;re playing tracks randomly. Thanks.		03 March 2011 - 03:30 PM	Hugh	[Thanks for the feedbackrequest. While it#39;s technically possible, currently there is no enough space for such extra information. Still I have this in mind, and probably a bit more space will be reserved for stuff like this for v2.0.];[Thanks. Ways to implement this could be as an optional alternative to the Album Art display or to optionally reduce the size of that area to provide more space.];
volume rocker to skip aheadback	Howdy- No question the best music player available. But one thing keeps me from buying the full version: my old w580 sony had the ability to skip aheadback using the volume rocker, even in the lockdark screen. Is it possible to add this feature? Made skipping around great while mowing the lawn. A thousand thanks for all your hard work.		05 March 2011 - 06:50 AM	ibashmuck	[Hi, (stock) Android doesn#39;t send volume key presses to background apps or when screen is off.This is possible on some non-stock ROMs, or via rooting the phone and using key remapping apps(for example, http:www.appbrain.... ... onremapper).Thanks!];
button to add current time to id3 tag	Hi, First of all, I#39;ve just started using Poweramp and, having tried a number of other music players, I have to say this is easily the best! It#39;s quick, simple to use yet full of features, slick, has a good lock screen widget, etc. so I#39;m impressed, well done I#39;ve got a slightly strange feature request...I#39;m a DJ and mostly listen to other DJ sets which are usually 1 hour plus (sometimes longer than 2 hours) in a single mp3 file. Whenever I hear a tune I like, I want to make a note of it so that I can go and buy it myself. When I#39;m driving my car this isn#39;t easy as I don#39;t have direct access to the tracklist, so I have to make a note of the time in the set the track was played, and then check at home later. Even making this note can be hazardous, or I have to keep stopping the car all the time (or I try to make a mental note but it#39;s easily forgotten). What I#39;d like is to be able to just press a button which simply appends the current time to an ID3 tag (eg. comment). Then when I get home later, I might see something like 13:19, 48:03, 89:52, which I can use to help me find the tracks I want. I#39;m a developer myself and know this should be a pretty simple task, and I know it#39;s not likely to be of use by anyone else, but it would be HUGELY helpful to me. When I become rich and famous as a superstar DJ I#39;ll know who to shower my money on if you can add this feature!		02 March 2011 - 11:38 PM	Zigo	[Hi, the feature you described is called bookmarks and it#39;s usually supported by audio-book players. Do you have .cue files with these long sets? PowerAMP has planned support for .cues. Thanks!];[Thanks for your reply. Yeah I mean like bookmarks for audiobooks. I don#39;t usually have .cue files but I can create a blank one easily. If this feature is added to Poweramp it would be fantastic];
smart playlist (as genius on itunes)	Hi, First of all, I#39;m french and so i don#39;t speak very well english. I would like to know : "have you planned to add a function as genius or a smart playlist for Poweramp?". Indeed it would be so great! Thank you answering my request.		19 February 2011 - 03:33 PM	lecubeur	[:up:];[If you mean automatic playlists such as "Most Played", "Last added" and "Recently played" , then yes - this is planned: viewtopic.php?f=3t=709];[I love this app (was my 1st purchase on my droid and most used), but the app so far is much like a Top 40 radio station that plays the same 10 songs over and over again. I have over 250 songs on my phone, and I should be able to go 5 - 6 hours before I hear a repeated song, but it#39;s not happening that way. Would you be able to do anything like that on this app?];[I like to group all my songs, regardless of type, into one folder. My folder contains over 250 songs. The problem I have is that the player is a lot like a Top 40 radio station, where it would play certain songs a bunch of times and it won’t play the rest at all. Is there any way for the player to keep track of songs played? Is the above listed ability that#39;s being added going to work this way? I#39;d be curious to know. Otherwise, it#39;s my first purchased app and my favorite app.];[Just press titlealbumartist minidisplay in PowerAMP when you feel that something is repeated and you#39;ll be navigated to the current played list - you can check it for duplications or any other issues. PowerAMP won#39;t repeat the list (folder) unless repeat is on and the list is completely played, even if the list is shuffled (items in it reordered). Thanks!];[Actually an iTunes Genius-like smart playlist is also something that i am wondering about. I have roughly 2,000 songs on my android device (and a whole lot more on my personal computer... i collect music). One of the features that i love in iTunes is the ability to select a song and the application automatically generates a playlist from within my own library of music that "goes well" or is acoustically similar to the song i chose. There is only one android media player that i have found that has this feature. As of right now i open the other app, select a song, let the app create a playlist, close that app, then open Poweramp and access the playlist from there. yes, it works, but i hate having two media players to accomplish this. Poweramp is far superior in every other aspect, and i am sure its going to be the first purchased app on my android device, but if i had a wishlist for the Poweramp Santa it would be for my very own smart auto generating playlist function. until then i will make due with my two-app solution.];
turn off end fading when changing track	I skip songs alot and I really don#39;t like the way Poweramp fades the last second before playing the song I selected. Will there be a way to turn this off in future?		02 March 2011 - 05:40 PM	Hatsune Miku	[I just registered to second this request. It#39;s very annoying and should be a basic option to toggle off.];[This "feature" is only for lower end non-neon devices which require large buffer. The fade is done to indicate PowerAMP started the track change, but as buffer is large (1 sec), there is a time to refill it (that 1 sec which is faded). Neon devices doesn#39;t have any fading now (but they will have optionaly with crossfade feature). Thanks!];[Sorry, but that#39;s kind of lame, no offense. Will you at least consider giving us the option of having it fade or not? It#39;s annoying to hear it every time I skip a track. I#39;d personally rather hear 1 sec of silence than a fade. If you don#39;t mind me asking why do you consider it a feature? I would think of it as more of a limitation, unless you actually programmed it to do that. Thanks for an awesome app though! I#39;m loving it otherwise. You seem to really care about feedback and making this the best app that it can be and that#39;s really cool to see.];[I personally don#39;t have a problem with, and actually love the fact that Poweramp fades to change song, I think that this is one of the features that sets it aside from the other media players available for android.

I think that the fade blends the next track in with the current on every nicely and it would be a shame to see that go perminatly];[If you are thinking of removing the fade out, at least KEEP IT AS AN OPTION as I like it as a feature and it would be a shame to see it go for good];

suggestion	i have just bought a license. i want to suggest for a larger font for texts in the player window as like i use my android as a secondary head unit. its kinda hard to read small fonts. if we (owners) can tweak font size and album art size, it will be much better because maybe not all want bigger text. and customizable theme colors too! thanks! -pao		04 March 2011 - 11:11 AM	presto	[Thanks for the request.

2 important features ! time search and quot;sensitive scrollingquot;	Hi, I think of 2 more features that would make this player the best in the wolrd - When I#39;m listening to an audiobook, i wish that i could save the position where i last stopped playing - so that i can continue at this position the next time i listen to the track. (Perhaps a feature to save the position in tracks with a length of more than 10 min would be possible) A feature like "Go to : " could also solve this problem. My next suggestion is to make the fast-forwarding within one track sensitive- like you have it on the Ipod (Touch). I mean that the fast-forwardingrewinding speed depends on the vertical postion of your finger relative to the timebar. I try to explain: When you touch down on the "progress bar" (that graphically shows you the playing position) and drag your finger to the right than the player should do the fast-forwarding the faster the bigger the vertical distance between your finger and the bar is ! This feature makes it more easy to precisely scroll to a certain position in long tracks Thats it, would be great to see these features with the next updae regards		21 February 2011 - 09:22 PM	easyraider	[Thanks for the feedback and requests!];[I like this "sensitive scrolling" idea, especially when listening to a DJ set that is really long, a small finger movement can change 5 minutes or more, so better control would be great];
always on lock screen widget	Hey, I was wondering if in a future version you might be able to add the option to always have the music widget displayed on the lock screen and not just when music is playing. The workaround to do this is by starting music and shutting off the screen (normal function). Afterward if the music is stopped the widget lock screen will continue to be the first displayed screen so long as you do not unlock the phone or press the To Lock Screen button.		01 March 2011 - 08:01 AM	mrmischievous	[Thanks for the request.

balance control	Hi, thanks for a great player! One thing I#39;d really like to see in an upcoming release i balance control. In fact, I haven#39;t seen any android player with balance control, and it would really put Power Amp further ahead of it#39;s competitors.

assigning eq presets to foldersalbums	The EQ is top stuff. Creating presets is working very well. But if you have a lot of different types of music in your library, it is also natural to have different EQ-settings based on the kind of music you are listening to. What I would like is a way to set the EQ preset for each album, or folder individually, so that I can set one type of EQ for my rock albums (or a specific album), and another EQ setting for my classical music albums for example. Is this something that would be considered for a future update?		28 February 2011 - 12:18 PM	Godbluff	[Thanks for the request. While the mass preset assignment is possible, PowerAMP (and other music players) has multiple views of the same song files via various lists. I mean, the same track can be in a folder, an album, an artist, playlist etc. This means that later preset assignment to a folder will override part of assignments done e.g. for the album, which has few songs in this folder. This is complicated and I#39;m not sure it will be well understood by majority of users. A lot of WTF from users will be expected.];[Fully understood I#39;ll work my way around it.];[Just wondering though, rather than applying them to a specific folder or artist in that case, wouldn#39;t simply assigning a preset to an entire genre itself resolve the issue?];[Genre is just another view to the same songs. I will think about mass equ preset assignments, but it should be well understood, that mass assigning can lead to sometimes unpredictableunexpected results, i.e. it will be for advanced users. Thanks!];
last lt;lt; playpause gt;gt; next on notification screen	Is this possible, like the stock player has? If I#39;m on any other app and want to switch the song, I have to pull down the notification curtain, click on Poweramp, hit next (or playpause whatever), then go back to the other app. It would be nice to access these functions in the pull down notification screen like the native player does. Thanks, guys. Really great work on this app.		28 February 2011 - 02:07 PM	bionik9	[Thanks for the request. While this is partially possible (not reliable though), the Notification drawer will close on every button press by the system. The API for extended UI (which is used by e.g. stock Samsung players) is not available to end developers for some reason. Google here is similar to M locking some low level OS features only for their software.];[Even if you can only make one push before the drawer closes this would be very useful. Most common case would be track skipping which usually should only be forwards. If you can only have one press, the back button should actually function as a "previous track" button instead of a 1-press for restart current song2-press prev song button. This would be great for those of us not using the widgets. If it#39;s possible to keep power amp in the notification drawer after hitting pause and having a play button there for the next pull of the drawer then I would really like to see this feature added. Cheers];
id3 tag quot;discquot; not recognized	As the title states, the ID3 tag for disc or disc number appears to be ignored. for example, i have an audio book with proper tag. There#39;s 6 discs with 99 files each. when you go to play them, it simply lists 6 track 1s followed by 6 track 2s, etc.		22 February 2011 - 10:37 PM	ramensama	[This is also bothering me very much. I have heaps of albums with more than one disc.];
music folders: can only pick from the root of the sdcard	When choosing your Music Folders, you can currently only choose folders in the root of the SDcard. This means that, if you use the Folder view (rather than the Library view) and if all your music is in e.g. sdcardmediaMusic, you have two unnecessary steps: you need to click #39;media#39; followed by #39;Music#39; each time. The solution would be to both (1) Make the Music Folder selection a tree view, to let you select any folder on the sdcard, not just one in the root; and (2) If you only have one Music Folder selected (e.g. sdcardmedia), the Folder view should show you the contents of it immediately, rather than make you click #39;media#39; to view the contents. Thanks, Simon		28 February 2011 - 07:13 PM	SEMW	[Thanks for the request. Yes the folder selection stuff will be polished a bit in next releases.];
colours	hello, i tend to use the library view a lot when on the street to look for a specific song. now my phone not being one the lucky ones with LED illuminated display, sunlight is a problem. i like that the background is black, but the text could be pure white. also the font for the song title could be just a little bit bigger (would help me a lot in finding a target song, while walking on the street, on a 3.2" dsiplay ) thanks!		27 February 2011 - 08:33 PM	misha0209	[Thanks for the request.

bugfix improvement concerning harddrive based system	Hi together, I#39;m using an archos 70it as MP3 player which has the specificity to work with a 250GB harddrive instead of flash memory. I tried to use Poweramp which was exactly filling my expectations in terms of ergonomy, functionality and quality. Congratulation then for this great work... ... BUT (there#39;s always a but...) after a fex seconds playback, Poweramp doesn#39;t play correctly and regularly, the playback is interrupted for 1 or more seconds, which is unfortunately not acceptable. I tried with many other programs available on Android, but until now only the application delivered by default by Archos is the only one to work. I tried to understand why this happens and I think that the difference between the played is related to the cache memory management: does Poweramp wait that the cache is almost empty to fll it at the last moment (saving the battery, while limiting memory access probably) or does it fills the cache more regularly? I may be problematic with a harddrive because the access time is very long (a few seconds if the HD is stopped physically, again to save battery) and the cache is probably empty when the new data are available. I precise that I tried the different options for cache memory (auto, normal or more) but I didn#39;t see any differences in the behaviour of the player: the HD is stopped and tries to start shortly before the music stops. This may be decisive: if a new version would correct this problem, I#39;d buy your application without hesitating. I thank you in advance for your feedback ! Do some of you experienced this kind of problems? Are there any solutions which I didn#39;t find? PS: Archos 70 it 250GB with Android 2.2; Poweramp V1.1 build 326		23 February 2011 - 10:11 AM	Ambientman	[Hi, thanks for the report, this is known issue with Archos 70+hdd - it stops hdd too frequently and spin up time just breaks sound. Archos devices don#39;t support google account on them and thus PowerAMP full version can#39;t be purchased and used on them. Though, I#39;ll try to fix this issue and most probably the fixed version (with few other tweaks for archos devices) will be available with the special Full Version Unlocker version for Archos (which binds to archos account).

[bluetooth] transmit tag to headunit	I am running Poweramp on a Desire HD in my car, the phone is connected via Bluetooth to a JVC KD R 711 headunit. Streaming to it, resume on connect, selecting nextprev song via headunit works flawlessly, the only thing it can#39;t do is display the name of the current song. The headunit theoretically is able to do it, the question is, is it limited by the phone or by Poweramp, if Poweramp is the problem, can we hope for an implementation of that feature?

Yes, it#39;s planned (not the same layout, but similar) - viewtopic.php?f=1t=172 "grid view for folders and albums" Though, the actual usability of this is pretty low (even your screenshot have a lot of duplications), so at least there should be album labels, not just images.];[duplicate album covers are due to those albums have multiple CDs and I managed in folder structure like#092;artist name - album name#092;CD1#092;#092;artist name - album name#092;CD2#092;];
nextprev folder via headset more encodings support?	Hi, it would be nice to be able to switch folders via headset. Button hold for next folder at least, but click+click and hold for next folder, double click+click and hold for prev. folder would be best. Any chances for that? Also, would it be much work to include more encodings support? (ISO-8859-2 and Win-1250) Thanks.		21 February 2011 - 09:47 PM	embrion	[Thanks for the requests. It#39;s actually possible to switch folders (or any other type of lists - albumsartistsplaylistsgenresetc.) with 3+ button headsets (i.e. with buttons). Long(or double - depends on settings) press on will switch it. Htc stock headsets, bt headsets like sony bt50 or SE mw600 are examples of such headsets. More encodings are possible (I#39;ll try to add the mentioned by you encodings, though, of course only if Android supports them)];[Thanks for answer. I know about BT headsets capability to do that but I prefer wired ones (because of SQ) and Samsung Galaxy S (and Samsung generally) offer only 1 button remotes. To make things worse, Nokia or HTC multi-button remotes extra buttons doesn#39;t work with Samsung. From my (coder) point of view, it there#39;s a function to handle folders switching and button hold action support, then joining those two wouldn#39;t take A LOT of coding time. I believe there would be a few people also interested in such feature. Could you think about implementing it ? Thanks for encodings part.];
track replay	When a song is currently playing, I would like to be able to tap on the Previous button to play that song again. Currently, there is no way to do this with Poweramp. The only poor workarounds are to go back to previous track, if any and tap of next track again; alternatively, I could drag the song time bar: not very good options. Poweramp should allow me to go back to beginning of currently playing track upon taping the Previous button once, subsequent tapping should then go to previous tracks. Please implement this option. Thank you, Otto		20 February 2011 - 05:06 PM	Ottoman	[That#39;s already an option in the latest releases. In "Settings" (Misc) "Look And Feel Tweaks", there is an option called " Button Resets Current Track". Just tick that. Andre];[Thanks, Andr¨¦! I will check that];
automatic retun to main view	Could you please implement a time-based mechanism that would allow the he player to return to the main screen, after certain amount of time has elapsed? I am new to Android and the back button is somehow new and properly implemented. Sometimes after changing some sound settings, I wish the player to automatically return to the main interface if left unchanged for some time.

mono setting in equalizer preset	Hi, I don¡ät know if anyone has come up with this request yet . I use my Galaxy S as an alarm clock. Like most other phones it has only got 1 loudspeaker.

sort by album more options, koreanjapanese sorting	1. At this build, Library view and sort by album mode is sort by album#39;s name A..B..C. In Apple iTunes, sort by album mode, first sorting by artist and then artist#39;s album A..B..C. A by Angela D by Angela A by Brian C by Brian . . . I would be great Poweramp has same option. 2. At this build, when I scroll down right scroll bar, It display A to Z. Any other Korean, Japanese, ... are under Z and it didn#39;t display any more letter. So it#39;s hard to find. Could you add KoreanJapanese letter when scrolling bar?

I will consider that type of sorting for v2.0. Note that you can see artist albums now via Artists in Library. 2. This will be possible when PowerAMP is localized to the appropriate languages.];
3d	The title says it all: we have functionality, but can we have some fancy 3D clip art, which is also functional, so you can flip tri-dimensionally and being able to select the song.

option for song sorting by artist in all songs	I know it#39;s kind of small, but this would help me and others out so much. Instead of ordering by song name in all songs, just order it by artist, sort of the way i tunes is set up on apple products. This would help to browse through music so much faster and i feel it#39;s just something that always should have been there.		21 February 2011 - 01:59 AM	inferno350z	
multi-info display	Could you please consider changing the second line (Artist - Album) or third one (default music folder) with changing metadata information of the track, such as Album, Contributing Artists, Composer, Release Year and so forth, instead of just static information, especially the folder one as it does not provide any useful information. Please add someting more dynamic, which updates base on the current song. Seeing the main windows with "Music" is waste of display space! Thank you, Otto		21 February 2011 - 12:10 AM	Ottoman	
quick browse	Unless I need to enable an option or doing something wrong, when browsing songs through the Music folder, I only see an option with a button to scroll faster on the right of the UI. Could you please add an option to browse by first letter while scrolling? This way, I can quickly select a song by sleeting the first letter of the song or artist name. For instance, if I am browsing the music folder from the beginning, by tapping on Y, this should take me at the end of the list to songs by Yana Kay, for instance. Currently, I have to scroll to all tracks and this is tedious! Please implement this useful feature! Is this an OS limitation? Thank you, Otto		20 February 2011 - 04:25 PM	Ottoman	
definition	I am currently looking for the ability to browse and play or sort songs by artist, album, gender, year..etc..as it has been requested several times. Yet, I read in your to-do-list for version 2.0 that “full-library search” will be implemented. Could you please clarify the use of this term and if it is in fact the above mentioned feature, could you please provide more details?		17 February 2011 - 03:15 PM	Ottoman	[You can currently browser in play by artist, album, artist albums, genre. No year at this moment, though too many groupings won#39;t work well for average user so they will be optional. Full library search is not related to this groupings and you can search full library right now by going into All Songs and using your hardware search button (or long press menu). This actually works for any PowerAMP list. v2.0 will have own library implementation, this will allow better by tag grouping due to own scanner, plus it will add some additional features for Folders list as well (due to the full library tag pre scan). Thanks!];[Sorry, how do I browse by artist? Please provide detailed procedure. In addition, if I can browse by artist, can I then play the selected artist#39;s songs? Again, if so, please explain. Is there any user guide? Thank you for your prompt response and attention. I am a glad user!];[I have found the option to browse the songs, but it is flawed. When I select an artist and when play all and if tap on the next track button, it plays a random track and not that of the artist in question (Shuffle mode on). This is a bug! This is not very user-friendly either: to do this, I had to tap on current track display window (without knowing why) [1st tapping], then tap on Library (2nd tapping) [I don#39;t why Library, then tap on Library, Artist and so on [3rd tapping]. There should be a button on the main screen for this important feature. This could even replace buttons such as Repeat (used once in a while if ever!) and this should take the user directly to the option to select by Album, Artist, Genre..etc... Please change this as soon as possible, without waiting for version 2.0. Thank you! Otto];
time, date and battery	Hello, Could you please add the possibility to display the time and maybe the battery level info? This would be particularly important when using Poweramp in full-screen mode. Thank you, Otto		20 February 2011 - 03:34 PM	Ottoman	
voice control	Hello, I have another request, following the TTS one: could you please implement voice control, as many application uses this API? This way, I could say "Play [song] or [artist]". I remember when I was using my old Windows Mobile with Microsoft Voice Command. When said "Play music", MVC would prompt me to say whether I wanted to play by album, artist or genre. Additionally, I could just say play the song, although not perfect, this was a cool application. Can you implement this? This would be perfect for people like me who use Bluetooth Stereo headphones with A2DP and AVRCP. Thanks, Otto		20 February 2011 - 03:26 PM	Ottoman	
song announcement	Hello, Could you please consider an option to include the song announcement before playing it? Given that the support of TTS is quite good, this should not be difficult. The implantation of this should be that, if enabled, Poweramp would read aloud the Titled, followed by the Artist, or as set by the user. For instance, before playing a track, Poweramp could say "Now playingNext track Sweet Dreams by Beyonc¨¦". Alternatively, this could be triggered by multiple press of a button.

music streaming! must have!	Any word on when Poweramp 2.0 is going to be released? I love Poweramp and all, but its really missing a feature that would put it at the top of the list, which is music streaming.

playlist combine feature	Would it be possible to have a playlist combine feature? For example, if I had a playlist called "fast songs" and one called "pop songs", I would use this feature to find songs that are on both playlists.

fine grain volume control	Hi there, I can#39;t be the only person to find the stepped nature of volume control on Android apps really annoying. We are talking digital devices here, so stepped increments are the order of the day. However, would it be possible to decrease the step "size" ? Better still, provide a degree of user configuration. Excellent product by the way. regards.		15 February 2011 - 02:40 PM	Goggleyes	[The android actually does it right from audiophile point of view (16 levels means there is division by twosamples shifted one bit - this doesn#39;t produce additional quantization noise comparing to fixed point division by non power of two numbers). But finer volume controls is nice to have and I already have some plans for it. It will only work in PowerAMP though. Thanks!];[I#39;m using Preamp when two subsequent volume steps are too low or too high for my comfortable listening. With the Preamp slider 34 up and the flat equalizer, simply pushing the EQ button gives the volume level exactly between the steps.

If this sort of thing were straight-forward, Poweramp wouldn#39;t be the uniquely impressive app that it is. Another vaguely related question. It would be great to be able to use the equalisation ability of Poweramp with other applications. Internet radio players etc, etc. Is it possible to "hijack" the audio output of another application with Poweramp (say) running as a background service - performing the necessary post processing ? I suppose I#39;m asking for Poweramp to act as an extension to the operating system, without having to root. regards james.];
poweramp wont see my sdcard, only tablet hard drive.	I just bought a Huawei s7 tablet, it doesn#39;t come with any way to play flac.

twitter and facebook integration	Finally a forum...hahaha First, Id like to say that im in love with Poweramp it makes my Android and music experience very worthwhile and i enjoy listening to music using this app. Ive gone thru this forum and have read many good additions that Max has said he will look into and you guys have have stated really good ideas. but no one has mentioned Twitter and Facebook integration so i can tweet my friends from Poweramp.

I hope there is some 3rd party app which can hold the twitterfacebook credentials and which can be notified by PowerAMP about current track - the way it#39;s done for last.fm scrobbling.

ScrobbleDroidSimple Last.FMofficial Last.FM are good examples of such apps.];[As I mentioned before, take a look at Audiogalaxy#39;s app - they have this set up and it works quite well.];[ Exodus615I take it this is you? http:twitter.comExodus615That explains a lot. Not a shock or anything but it will make the rest of this post more valid.Please explain to me why the hell you would need facebook integration? First off how old are you, 12? News flash: Your fake friends on facebook don#39;t give a crap you are rocking out to the backdoor boys in the back of your parents minivan. Seriously. I know it hurts to hear, but they don#39;t care. We don#39;t either. The whole rest of the planet could care less what you are listening to on your phone. How does that feature help anyone? Please explain to me one rational, logical reason you need to share what crap music you listen to with the rest of the world? The only reason anyone on the web needs to know what you are listening to is if you happen to be a DJ and streaming music using shoutcast or something similar from your phone to many listeners. We all know that#39;s not the case as your phone does not have enough bandwidth over 3g4g to do that and no self respecting DJ would do so from his cell phone.There is no reason you need that feature other then to stroke your own ego on facebook. If this app turns into some social networking crap I will not be buying it or recommending it on other forums. Social networking is the drudge of the internet. Its bad enough these little kids complained to cell phone companies they wanted social networking as part of the Android OS, now we all have to deal with lag on our phones due to this bloatware crap. The irony is they don#39;t even use the social networking apps built into the device, they download the independent app from each site. So you bi.tch and moan you dont have facebook built into Android and then when you get it use the independent facebook app instead. Now you want to go ruin the only promising 3rd party music app with social networking crap. Again, NO ONE CARES what you are listening to on your phone. NO ONE.Dev, please do not waste your time on social networking crap in your app. There are plenty of other feature requests that are far more important. If i start seeing extra app permissions needed like network use for social media, its getting uninstalled immediately. Unnecessary app permissions are a security risk and unneeded network use kills battery life.This is a music player app. Its a damn good one too, probably the best on the market. Please don#39;t screw it up.I think people crashing their car trying to manually look through a playlist instead of using a voice command is a far more of a concern. In fact, there are plenty of much more valuable features people have posted on this forum that should be the focus of your effort before social networking crap. If you do feel the need to code something social network oriented, please consider making it a separate app. In the [non-ghetto] adult world, there is no reason for anyone to post what music they are playing on facebook or twitter. None.Thank the gods Web 3.0 is no longer focusing on social networking and going back to a traditional internet.];[Thank you Max for looking into it];[Hi,i looking for this feature, too. anyway if someone say, this is crap...i wish feature like in this PLUGIN for WINAMP on Windows.look here: http:twittamp.dev2.husorry for my bad english. it#39;s not my native LanguagegreetingsKryptiK :mrgreen:];[LMFAO, gotta love the trolls. he really went all out.

idea + headset problem + openwatch request	Hi !Your problem is amazing, I am using it since two months, but I tried Music Pro Player, and you miss some great features from it (and it miss from feature from Poweramp ).Poweramp has really a cool design, the folder system is perfect, but I miss some feature :(1) The lyrics system is so cool ! Any hope for a tag system for the web?Also, can#39;t you add a button on the player to directly access to the lyrics?(2) I#39;ve got a MBW-150 and I don#39;t know if you know OpenWatch, but I have to way to control my songs with my watch. Also, I don#39;t recieve the title and artist songs on my watch.The only thing that works is the volume control.(3) On my HTC Desire HD, the headset control doesnt#39; work on Poweramp (even with settings are OK)Anyway, your player is simply AMAZING !

You may try to switch to DoubleTriple presses in PowerAMP settingsHeadset Options - this may help.];[Thank you for your answer ! 1. Yeah sorry, I saw it after I posted. 2. Okay, thank you. 3. Hmm, maybe, but I have no problem with Music Pro Player. That#39;s strange. Anyway, keep up the amazing good job];[HI, regarding Openwatch, you are right that we can control Poweramp as we can do via headset, but Openwatch has some other useful features, like displaying the actual song#39;s details. There is an API for openwatch so basically you could push some information about the songs we start to listen. Can you please give look into it? In case you don#39;t know openwatch, here is a link: http:forum.xda-dev...ad.php?t=554551thank you in advance!];[Hi,I#39;ve just purchased this amazing player. I use it nearly every day with my Galaxy S I wan#39;t to buy a Sony Ericsson bluetooth watch in the near future (from the older MBW series) so i hope you could do something about integration with OpenWatch which already supports a massive amount of applications. You can send Android intents to OpenWatch for text display requests, see the API: http:www.smartmads... ... amp;topic=151 I think this will do the job for track displays (Meridian is using this API for example) but maybe you could cooperate with smartmadsoft to do a more tighter integration (OpenWatch already has some support for Poweramp using media button emulation).I hope to see this feature in the app soon];[Any chance for this function to get implemented? I got the watch now. At least a public API for Poweramp would be nice, so other apps could controll it and listen to track change events through Intents. I think i could write a little glue app then to send data from Poweramp to OpenWatch and vica-versa.];[There will be some a bit more open PowerAMP API (intents, notifications) available for 3rd party apps like this in one of the next minor PowerAMP updates, that will certainly allow better integration with various apps like this. Thanks!];[Sounds great Thank you, and please keep us informed.];
independent equaliser per track or auto equaliser	Again I noticed that earlier CDs ripped to mp3 are fairly quiet, and fairly flat in their sound, so I bump up the base, then a more modern track comes on and is way too loud, and the base distorts as there is too much. Can you either preset an equaliser per track (and it remembers the set up) or add something like a global equaliser setting (ie rock) and an auto equaliser keeps all tracks somewhere close to the requested setting without distorting the base? That and auto volume would be the best features Poweramp could add... Keep up the good work guys!!		16 February 2011 - 07:35 PM	garryramp	[Thanks for the request. PowerAMP already has eq preset per song (from version 1.1, such preset will be market with small S icon if set for current song). Auto limiter for Eq is planned for v2.0.];
notification controls	Would it be possible to ad playpausenextprevious song on the notification bar instead of just saying what song is playing? That is the only thing I really like about the default one on the galaxy s phones.		14 February 2011 - 05:00 AM	maptwo3	[Generally no (android doesn#39;t support anything beyond one big touchable area there), but with some hacking it may be possible on Samsung Galaxy S series. Thanks!];[Aw well that sucks, its the only thing that makes me want to use the galaxy s one, but of course Poweramp still wins there.];[The app Power Control Plus (which is essentially a very configurable system settings widget) allows placing controls in a notification. I#39;m not sure what the limit is but I was able to add over nine buttons. (It#39;s not as responsive as I would like but then again changing system settings is a little slow no matter where you do it.)];[Thanks for the reference. This app is able to recognize separate button presses on notification bar (nice hack), but the notification drawer is closed immediately as Android still controls it completely. On SGS, you can control player without closing drawer each time. Not sure if such approach will work for PowerAMP, but I#39;m keeping eye on any progress in this area.];
display current track total tracks when at player screen	Hi there, Is it possible to have the current playing track number and disc total tracks number displayed on the player screen? (ie: 213) I#39;m almost always listening to new albums and would love to be able to see what track number I#39;m on without having to go into the playlist and count manually. I can#39;t really say where to put it so you keep the clean look it currently has in the info box... Logically I would put it to the right side in line with either the track, artist or album name or possibly below the progress bar inline with the bitrate info? Anyways, it would be great to have it added as an option under look and feel tweaks. Thanks for your consideration on this feature. Keep up the great work! Cheers, Mike		14 February 2011 - 06:10 PM	elgorbo	[Thanks for the request. This is planned feature.];
shufflerepeat	The way you say shuffle and repeat is kind of confusing. When you press shufflerepeat it says either "all songs" "current artist" or "off". When it shows all songs, when I am on just one artist, it will shufflerepeat songs from everything on my player. But if I am listening to the dynamic queue, it will only shufflerepeat songs from there. This can be kind of confusing. So basically what I think you should do is just give us the option to shuffle the current playlist instead of all songs or current artist. That would mean if we start playing from one artist, that would be the playlist and it would repeat and shuffle just that. Thanks again		15 February 2011 - 04:51 AM	maptwo3	[Thanks for the feedback. Shuffle all will shuffle all songs (either from all folders or from library - these sub sets of songs can differ), but yes, queue takes priority and in any shuffle mode except OFF, it will first what is in queue, then, when queue is done it will return back where it was in shuffled all songs list. There is no point in queue which doesn#39;t queue anything in shuffle modes, thus queue was given priority over all lists even in shuffle all mode. Repeat modes (except repeat one song) won#39;t work for queue at all (but it will restore the repeat mode when queue is done). Re: shuffle current playlist. PowerAMP has shuffle modes for current or specifically selected playlistallbumartistfoldergenere. Depending on the source listcontext the appropriate "Shuffle by" mode will be available. And if you long press (or right press arrow) some albumartistgenrefolderetc and select shuffle button there, it will shuffle by the given list.];
screensaver	I like to listen to music at night, and I also like having a clock. Right now, I use Poweramp as my media player, and alarm clock plus as my clock. Basically what I would like is for an option for the screen to timeout after a while to just a big dim clock.		15 February 2011 - 05:04 AM	maptwo3	
album art selection settings	Hello, you#39;re player is really awesom, i dont really miss any feature! I am on Android for some days and found it, when i searched for a player with equalizer as my device has a low maximum loudness and i think will buy it at the end of the test period due to the fact that all the other players i found are not really as good as yours. But it#39;s the first time i am on a payed app platform, so firstly i have to look how the android market payment thing work... now here is my request: i have alot samplers on my SD and i dont like to see the sampler cover for a song, but more likely the cover of the real album of the single or at least only a picture of the artist, so maybe you could add an option to chose what Poweramp search for: artist + album artist artist + title artist + album + title btw.: i read something about Poweramp 2.0... if i buy 1.1, i will be able to use 2.0 with the same licence?		13 February 2011 - 06:27 PM	ladiko	[Hi, thanks for the feedbackrequest. PowerAMP actually binds downloaded album art to (one of the): - artist + album - artist + title (singles) From searching practice, searching for just title or artist or just album makes little sense (non-appropriate trash is found). Searching for artist + album + title also doesn#39;t make much sense, you#39;ll get the best results for artist + album query, as it matches album. But I#39;ll think about adding more options to album art engine, may be even the rules proposed by you (via some options). 2.0 will be a bigger update to 1.*, so yes, you#39;ll be able to use it with the same licenseUnlocker.];[how does Poweramp chose weather it uses artist + album or artist + title? i would like to be able to force the search for artist + title to avoid searching for the sampler#39;s name. is there a prefered release date for 2.0 (without guarantee)?];[Artist + tile is used for singles - when there is no album tag at all. There is no date for 2.0, it#39;s scheduled on spring 2011. Thanks!];[as i dont want to remove the album tag, an option to force the artist + title tab would be great, furthermore i dont care about data usage. does Poweramp use embedded album arts? thank you in advance];
equaliser by album	Wow - this a great media player, I don#39;t use anything else except, occasionally, Lithium, once in a while for crossfade (but I see that#39;s coming in PA V2.0 - fantastic news). Anyhow, I love the ability in the latest update to save equaliser settings, but could we have a function to apply to a range of tracks or more essentially per album, rather than per track for custom settings. This is useful but would lead to hundreds of different equaliser pre-sets and albums tend to suffer from the same problems when it comes to lack of tone. Just allowing the application of any EQ setting to an album would be awesome.		13 February 2011 - 12:17 PM	richard127	[Thanks for the request. This is planned, though I#39;m still thinking about the bestsimple as possible UI for that. Otherwise Preset assignment will be too complicated for average user to use (with all these options).];
sleep	Now that there is a sleep timer, maybe you could add a button on the menu, instead of going into settings to get it as that is kind of annoying to do every time.		14 February 2011 - 05:04 AM	maptwo3	[Thanks for the request.];
make player better for long audio podcasts - ffrw resume	The player is GREAT seriously great, but it really is only geared to music. But it could be great for audio podcasts as well (you have no idea how important an EQ is for podcasts) the problem is there is no way (that I see) to FF or RW through a track or skip a predetermined length of time. Adding these features would be great (how about a long press and hold on the forward button for FF and opposite for RW) - and you could add trackball support for ffRW And a adj button to skip an X # of seconds in a track. Finally having the player pick up where a track was when paused or exited would be invaluable for podcast support. I am sure I am not the only one who would like to use you amazing app for audio beyond music.		03 November 2010 - 07:26 PM	faltime	[Thanks for the request. Better support for long files expected in one of the next minor releases.];[This sounds like a great idea! Another thing I#39;d like to suggest would be a separate selection for audiobooks andor podcasts in the library view (and perhaps an option to set folders for audiobooks and podcasts). This is one thing I do miss about my iPod - keeping audiobookspodcasts separate from music. Automatic bookmarking would be nice for audiobooks, too.];[I too use my phone largely for listening to podcasts, so the above features would be very welcome indeed. Especially the "press-and-hold headphone button" for fast-forwarding or fast-reversing within a track (like the default music player already does).Sliding left or right on the trackpadball would be a great way to skip a given number of seconds too - e.g. skip forward 30 seconds (ideally with a configurable value available, as some podcasts can be an hour or two long).Finally, I get quite a few MP4 videos which auto-download into the same podcast folders, so it#39;d be really useful to have an option to select which extensions the player will look for (the easiest would be to have a full list in the settings screen, with tick-to-select, so I can just disable MP4).Oh, and an option to auto-refresh the folderfile list on startup of the player would be excellent so it picks up any newly-downloaded podcasts automatically.This is a GREAT piece of software and I will be buying it shortly. Thank you for all the hard work on it.Andre];[Next minor release (coming tomorrow) includes fix for long mp3 seeking - it#39;s instant now. Better support for podcasts is considered, though PowerAMP is primary a music player, but such functionality is very useful for long tracks as well (long sets, etc.)];[Thank you, one of the great things about the very best software is when users get to discuss options with the developer. The product always benefits from features that may not otherwise have been considered. Thanks for your time. Andre];[These features being implemented is my only bar to entry. I#39;m sure many others feel the same.];[Me too. There are partial solutions on Android but none that work very well (AstroPlayer has bookmarking and even podcatching, but doesn#39;t have the option to bookmark just audiobooks, and I don#39;t want individual songs bookmarked).I#39;m not really looking for something to do the podcatching itself (I use BeyondPod to actually download podcasts), just something to play long files with bookmarks and keep things separate from music files through picking a folder in the settings.];[Even better (for me anyway) than a defined ffrw would be a goto command. Something that allows you to jump to 24:35 for example.];[FF and RW should be possible also on the widget. Long press do not work in widgets(it usually edit it) so I think there should be included a Progress time bar on the widget. How about it? I am using QuickDesk only to launch Poweramp widget in front of any app. It just a floating window to control the music without closing current app. It is great, but the only thing missing in the widget is the Progress time bar to have total control over the music being played!];[The only issue with progress bar in widgets is that it will require frequent (0.5 sec) updates to widget and this will plain eat the battery. Unfortunately, on Android widget updates are not optimal, widgets are saved to the flash on each update and each widget update should update all the widget, not just changed part of it. This is esp. problem for SGS series, as flash writes are 10x slower on them (or even more). HTC for example, solves this via their home screen customization - elements which looks like widgets are actually HTC home screen extensions without such limitation, this lets them add progress bar without such problem. Though, I#39;m keeping eye on the issue and may be something comes up.];["Poweramp is primarily a Music Player". I hear this a lot and I think it#39;s sad. do you think iPod would be as succesful had it been "primarily a music player"? there is nothing stopping any program from fulfilling the functions of both music and podcastsaudiobooks.];
two requests	Option to Turn onoff autostart of program upon headphone jack insertion. (I have a square Credit Card reader - Power Amp turns on every time I plug it in) Option to cancel screen time out (For those of us who keep our phones plugged into a cig lighter adapter in the car, it#39;s two less buttons to push while driving and changing songs.

poweramp #39;now playing#39; broadcasts?	I#39;m working an Android app that utilizes the #39;Now Playing#39; track information from the default Android Music Player to do something. While this works like a charm on most cooked ROMs and HTC stock ROMs, but for people using other music players, this obviously fails. The Android Music Player sends out broadcasts on specific actions with Intents such as:- com.android.music.metachanged com.android.music.playbackcomplete and the artist, track and album information is bundled with the Intent. My question is: Does Poweramp send out any broadcasts when these events occur? If not, then is there any possible way in which I can get the Now Playing information from Poweramp?		11 February 2011 - 12:09 PM	m1k3y	[1. PowerAMP doesn#39;t send exactly these intents - these are reserved for stock android player. For example, HTC player sends different intents 2. PowerAMP sends very similar "SLS" or scrobble Droid intents, if the appropriate scrobbling is activated. Thanks!];[Yes, I know, for HTC it is: com.htc.music.metachanged For Samsung, it is: com.sec.android.app.music.metachanged For Winamp, it is: com.nullsoft.winamp.metachanged What are the action names for Poweramp?];[Only #2 (from my prev post) are provided - 2 scrobbling apis.];
playlists: quot;not in any playlistquot; and others...	I suggest to add the automatically generated playlists: 1. "Not in any playlist" 2. "Recently added" (with setting for what period) 3. "Last played" = last X songs, were played from the beginning to the very end. "X" could be set to time period or amount of songs.		10 February 2011 - 04:18 PM	AndrewMe	[Planned - check here: viewtopic.php?f=1t=172 Thanks!];
import doubletwist playlists	It would be great if Poweramp could import playlists from other android audio players. The most useful would be support for the doubleTwist .m3u playlists, which are placed in the upper level music directory on the android phone. Many users use doubleTwist to sync iTunes playlists on their PC to their android phones, but use Poweramp as their player in android because it is far superior to the doubleTwist player. Thank you for your consideration of this enhancement.		04 February 2011 - 08:41 PM	jhaben	[jhaben, while we wait for playlist support can you explain how i get Poweramp to see all my music on my droid? i have rescanned folders multiple times but there are songs in doubletwist that Poweramp does not see];[Thanks for the request. m3u files are supported and parsed by some android phones natively (songsplaylists appear in LibraryLibrary playlists).];
multiselection of tracks	Is it possible to adddelete to playlist several tracks at a time. For example I#39;d like to add to a playlist this, this and that track. Or I#39;d like to add from this to that track from a folder to listen to. Or, for instance, I#39;d like to delete this, this, this and that tracks at a time from playlist, but not one by one.		09 February 2011 - 11:21 AM	ZeroBit	[Such selection is planned, but it is not in the current builds (the use case is very narrow). Multi-addition is possible of course (i.e. whole folder, or filtered songs, etc.). Thanks!];
activate voice control with headset button	When using the default music player, I can activate voice control with a long push down of the headset button (in addition to pauseplaynext with single or double click). With Poweramp, controlling the music works fine after enabling headset buttons in the settings. Unfortunately the ability to launch voice control and hence the ability to make phone calls with the headset button is lost. This is a no go for me. Otherwise I would buy the app, as I really like it.		08 February 2011 - 01:02 AM	dshrek	[When PowerAMP is active, and headset support is enabled, PowerAMP will capture headset controls. It#39;s not possible to pass them to underlying components as this will cause other 3rd partystock players to playexecute headset commands. PowerAMP bypasses headset commands when the call is in progress, though.];[Hi, ok, I understand the problem. Is it not possible to include an explicit option in Poweramp that it should start a user defined application on a specific headset control action?];
remeber each songs last playing position	I have just started using your program. I think it is absolutely awesome. Really 5 stars! Keep up the good work. One thing I really would like, is for the program to remember the last playing position for each song, (or at least a bookmarking option). I listen to long mp3 lectures, and this function is absolutely necessary, since I listen to different lectures at different times. (Please note that many other products on the Market actually have this function, although be sure their general product doesn#39;t come near yours!) Please help me (us), I am sure many users (or potential users) will benefit from this added feature.		08 February 2011 - 09:34 AM	njkl	[Thanks for the feedbackrequest. The each song playing position remembering is not appropriate for Music playing, but it#39;s a good feature for audio book player. I#39;m not sure PowerAMP will go this way though. If it#39;s possible to add it without adding any overheadissues for music playing (as option), it will be done.];
reorder songs in the queue	Hi! The new Queue is great, that is exactly what I needed! One thing that remains: I need also the ability to reorder the songs in the queue. Like in PlayerPro or WinAmp: if you drag a song (touch it at its leftmost area), you can release it somewhere else in the list. That would be a great addition that makes Poweramp complete - for me at least Br, Kris		08 February 2011 - 04:26 PM	aczelkri	[Thanks for the request, this is planned feature.];
quot;preview modequot; - play nownext from album art.	One feature I would love to see is a preview mode where you can scroll through a playlist or album via the artwork on the Now Playing screen and a "flick up" to play the found song or a flick down to play the song next. Music (Remix) 2 on webOS has this and it is the only thing I miss about webOS since moving to Android.Here#39;s a link to what I mean - right at 8:10 into the video.		08 February 2011 - 06:17 PM	solarus	[Thanks for the request.];
main program on sd card	Hello folks, I enjoy Poweramp alot and use it on my HTC Desire. But Poweramp is quite using a few memory ressources of my device.

Cheers, Casamonte		01 February 2011 - 06:17 PM	casamonte	[Android OS doesn#39;t support widgets for sd card installed apps, and PowerAMP has 4 such widgets.

external sd card folders in folio 100 tablet	I installed yesterday the trial version of Poweramp. Looks promissing, however I don#39;t get it to show the folders I have in the external sd card. While the songsalbums in these folders are shown in Library mode, they are not however shown in Folder mode. The external sd card is automatically mounted in mntsdcardsdcard-disk0.

Android supports only one external storage (i.e. sd card, but some vendors choose to point external storage to internal flash drive).

automatic rating system ala amarok	I know that there is a rating system planned for a future release. I#39;d love such a feature. But i would like to ask Max if he would consider adding an automatic rating system like Amarok has. I, like many other people i guess, have a very large music collection, and i usually do not have the time or the willpower to manually rate every single song. However, with an automatic rating system i can create a playlist based on that automatic score and forget about having to assign a value to each song. For those that do not know how Amarok rates the songs, it is based on how long you play the song. Every song starts at a score of 50100 and then every time the song is played it modifies the score. If the song is skipped at the very beginning, the score is halved. If the song is played till the end, the score is increased on half of the difference between the actual score and 100. And if the song is skipped and any time between the beginning and the end, it adds or substracts lineally. So, for example, if a song were played 4 times till the end and then it was skipped at the very beginning, its scores would be: 1. 50 2. 75 3. 88 4. 94 5. 97 6. 48 Well, at least that is how i always thought it worked, although i may be wrong. Anyway, i think this would be a great addition for an already great player.		04 February 2011 - 04:05 PM	apertotes	[Thanks for the detailed request.];[I forgot to explain one reason why i love this feature. There are some songs that i think are just great andor beautiful. I think they deserve 5 stars. I am talking about pieces like High Hopes from Pink Floyd, Unchained Melody, Stairway to Heaven, November Rain, Suspicious Minds... Well, i am sure you get the idea. There are many, many songs that i humbly believe they deserve the top rating. But, i do not feel like listening to them every day, or even every week. Thus, if i create a playlist based on my manual rating, i would have to skip all those great songs almost every day, until they come up one day i am really in the mood to listen to them. On the other hand, there may be songs that are not that incredible, like This is the life, Word up, Always be my baby or Boombastic, but you just like listening to them. You can safely rate them with 2, 3 or 4 stars, and let the player learn that although those songs will never get into any Top 100 list, you want to listen to them more than you would confess to your friends. Of course, then there are those legendary songs that will get 5 stars and will be listened to every single day. Yes, i am talking about The Final Countdown, One, Bohemian Rhapsody and Give into me. Well, an automatic rating system will also agree with you and will kindly play those songs for you every day, even without asking for. This is why an automatic rating system is more than great. It learns your current likings even better than yourself, and even more, it is dynamic. It will update its ratings everytime a song is played. This way, you will see how the player gets better every day at playing your favorite songs, not those you think are great songs, but those you really want to listen at this point of your life.

I own an HTC Desire HD, and to do that, I can either use the default player, which allows to choose a player (either phone, or UPnP), thru the "Play to" option, either I use an external app, such as 2player or iMediaShare.Would it be possible in a future release, to add an option to choose to play the smartphone music either on the phone speaker (normal use) either on UPnP ready apparel ?Besides, maybe some users would find usefull a full UPnP protocol support (I mean both being able to "transmit" music from the phone, and to "receive" music from UPnP devices.).Again, I really have no idea of the feasibility of such a feature, but I#39;d be so cool.Best regards		01 February 2011 - 02:25 PM	Spartan	[Thanks for the request.

album art for each track	using "filename.jpg" for each trackI have a folder, named "singles" with a lot of single tracks in it, not assigned to a specific album.Each track has it#39;s own album art (filename.jpg).It would be perfect, if these album arts are displayed when the tracks are played.For example look at the mortplayer app, where this is working perfectly.		01 November 2010 - 08:31 PM	tourist	[I will add this to my TODO list. Thanks for the request. (Currently, if there is no embed art in the file and there no album art can be found in internet, albumart.jpb or cover.jpg or albumart*.jpg or (if all the above failed) any jpg wil be shown as album art.)];[you can add the albumart to the song with id3 tags. imo its the cleanest way and you don#39;t have to worry about image files in the folder.];[Hi Max, Poweramp is getting better and better and it#39;s nearly perfect! But the fact that album art for single tracks which have no embed album art but a jpg file "filename.jpg" in the same folder is not currently shown in the now playing screen is driving me crazy!

THANKS!];[touristPowerAMP doesn#39;t check for .jpg, but it checks for .jpg in the song#39;s folder. Each check for a file takes considerable time (Esp. on lower end devices) so that#39;s why the probe list is limited.

better transition between songs?	Hi, I#39;m new here and I#39;m using Poweramp for months But I would suggest, since I listen a lot of electro sessions (tiest?, ...) some albums are mixs who are cut track per track. I#39;d like to keep them in this state with no assembly, so for users like me (and I think there is many), could you try to make Poweramp doing better transitions between songs, I mean no time between two songs, or maybe this is a system limitation... Hope it hasn#39;t been said already, but I#39;m French and maybe I use the wrong keywords.

set custom eq preset for entire albumsfolders	The option to set a custom preset for entire albumsfolders would be real handy. Having to set each song in a specific albumfolder to a custom EQ Preset one at a time can become a pain. Thanks for the consideration!		05 February 2011 - 09:45 PM	JRod	
delete buttonfunction	While playing LIBRARY playlist the function of "Delete" button is to delete from SD card - there no possibility to remove a song from playlist, which is actually playng - right from the player mode. Suggestion: to add aa extra button "Delete from playlist". May be, it makes sense to make a possibility to choose between equalizer controls and playlist controls in the player mode. (I personally change equalizer settings practically once - at the very beginning of usage, but changing playlists for me - very dynamic process. Am I alone? )		01 February 2011 - 06:40 AM	AndrewMe	[I like this idea. I was just about to post a similar request. So I#39;ll bump your topic with it. Delete from LIBRARY. My little brother likes to play The Sims on my phone. In order for him to be able to play it, The Sims stores a number of various MP3s on the internal SD. The problem is, Poweramp adds them to the library even though they#39;re not in my sdcardMusic folder. The only music I want to have in my library is in my sdcardMusic folder, and even then there#39;s a couple I#39;d like to remove fro my library. So, a Delete from Library option would be fantastic. Its quite a necessity actually.];[Deleting the file from sd card (form main screen menu DELETE action) when playlist is played is probably design oversight. - it should delete from current list, and for playlists and queue this means just entry deletion, not file deletion. For queue, delete button properly removes from queue not deleting the file. Thanks for the request!];[No-no! Please, don#39;t! For me it#39;s one of the key feature of this player actually, I use it a lot. At least, if you want to change this functionality, add an option to preferences so that user would be able to choose which action is to be taken on pressing delete button.];[Fully agree - I do use this feature minimum 10 times a day.But operations with playlists are for me more important. So, I suggest to make both functions easy accessible.];
hdmi output (evo)	I know this might sound like beating a dead horse but I am asking here because I wonder if anyone here knows. The Evo has a mini hdmi output, which of course includes audio. I have a complete 7.1 set of speakers in my auto. I have been using a carputer for some time to run my infotainment, but this phone dt oes everything I really need... and wont require me to buy a bigger alternator to run it. I am hung up on being able to drive the surround system from the phone. Hell the thing has the full digital surround output potential, all I#39;d need to supply would be a nice set of dac#39;s and I#39;d be in business, right? Is this a pipe dream?		05 February 2011 - 04:25 AM	crooozin	[Right, this is interesting idea, I think generally ROM should be able to redirect audio stream to hdmi, but this is not something standard to Android. Standard Android audio "outputs" are wired headsetbt a2dpspeaker, and OS routes active music stream to one of these outputs automatically. So basically you need to test if it works on Evo this way. Thanks!];
more control on folder pics in folder view mode	First of all let me thank you for the great software. However, I#39;d like to suggest to introduce a bit more luxury. To the point: Browsing my music library I mostly use folder mode. Automatic search for album art is a great feature, especially with the ability to choose the right picture from the found variants. But unfortunately this is not extended to the folders. As far as I understood, currently you take a first picture found for one of the files inside the folder and use it instead of default folder icon. There are two problems here: 1. Folder picture is rarely the picture of my choice, but I did not find any way to change it at will 2. If folder contains no files (just another folders) the picture is always default. Sometimes this behaviour drives me crazy... Hence the feature request: a) Needed an ability to change folder picture to the picture of user#39;s choice (pics saved for files contained in this folder can be used as choices in the list) Nested folders must be scanned for the folder pictures as well		03 February 2011 - 01:36 PM	NowhereMan	[Thanks for the feedbackrequest. 1. Image in the music folder usually is the "right" picture to show, unless you have your music collection seriously mixed. PowerAMP will prefer embed art, and also it#39;s possible to let it ignore jpegs in folders via Prefer Downloaded Album Art option in album art options. For Select Album Art - I added possibility to change "micro" thumb shown in Folders list (and in Albums lists as well) - this will be in the next market update and sooner - on the site. If you manually select album art for any song from the folder - it will update the micro thumb as well plus it will update Album#39;s thumb (if album tag exists). 2. PowerAMP will show such folders only in Hier. mode, and yes, default folder icon will be shown - as there is currently no any GUI to change folder image. I will consider adding such UI, but not sure about usability of this - it#39;s not possible to search for image for some random folder name without the song (albumartisttitle) context, so I#39;m not sure what it should allow to select from (what images). May be the child folders images, if child folders exist.];[I have many folders like "The WhoThe Ultimate CollectionCD1". I noticed, that if you update the album art in a file in CD1, it does change the picture for all files in CD1, the folder picture for CD1 but not the folder picture for CD2 [although I think it shows the new AA in the player]. Also, as already mentioned, I would also like if the parental folder [e.g. The Ultimate Collection] would have the same picture as its subfolders [CD1 and CD2]. If they are the same, this should not be that big of a problem I guess. Thank you];

support for android 1.6?	Hi, Would it be possible to support Android 1.6? I have an xperia x10 phone with a hardware bug and I can not update to 2.1 unfortunately. Thank you		28 January 2011 - 07:38 AM	moonman	[Thanks for the request, but unfortunately it#39;s not possible (mostly because of issue with native libs in 1.6, and PowerAMP is 70 native code).];[Thank you for your reply Would it be possible to replace some libs on a rooted phone to make it work? What libraries does it depend on? In general, if there was a possibility to make it work, what would an end user have to do? I did purchase the power amp, however 2.1 was not stable on my phone. Now I cannot make it work at all and after talking to Sony Ericsson they confirmed I need to change the phone for 2.1 to work. The phone is out of warranty now. Anyway, if it is not possible at all I don#39;t mind having 5 dollars donated for a great player!];[The major problem is the android 1.6 linker implementation.

auto-advance vs manual forwardback	I just realized that the two Auto-Advance features apply only to, well, auto advance – dugh :oops: ! But I was trying to use it to prevent manual advance to go to the next folder. This can be annoying.

disable mediaringer volume popup when using poweramp	I love the way Poweramp looks with the Black Neon skin and the statusbar hidden. When I use volume control or ringer volume buttons a popup is displayed also showing the volume and I feel it is quite distracting and unnecessary to have this extra Android notification. Can it be disabled somehow?		04 February 2011 - 04:10 AM	Hatsune Miku	[Yes, technically it can be hidden. Though I specifically left it to indicate the global media volume change. Also, it makes sense only in Eq screen and may be in main screen with small volume knob (if eq is not hidden).];
zappin feature	I use this player a lot, and i#39;m loving it. I listen to my music thats on my mobile while driving, but sometimes i struggle to find the song I am looking for. I saw SONY#39;s MEX-BT3800U car audio system and they have got a ZAPPING feature in them.

external sd recognition	Hello Poweramp, First of all a big thank you for your magnificent music player. The customizability is superb. I#39;ve got a series of devices that I use at work, HTC Desire, HTC Desire Z and so forth and the player works great with my 16Gb SD Card. They don#39;t have internal storage so we#39;re golden. However; I now have a new kind of device, running on Android 2.2, which has an internal storage card (which I don#39;t like at all). I am forced to stick all my music in the "mntsdcardMusicFolders" folder, which is autocreated via the menu option in the folder settings menu. Only then I am able to use the Folder function (which is the best adition with respect to other players, alongside with the superb album art support). now for my question; is it possible that in a future release support for external SD cards in combination with folders is implemented? thanks for your support.		03 February 2011 - 02:49 PM	Frenske	[Thanks for the request.

save album art	Hi. Simply because your Power Amp is very accurate to download album covers ( it has found many many covers for polish albums, no other software could find) I would suggest you to add ability to save downloaded covers into folder or file tag. I think it should be pretty simple to do, and could turn your player in album art downloader. P.S. Thank you, app is marvellous.		02 February 2011 - 11:39 AM	hedeon	[Thanks for the feedbackrequest. Album art images are saved to sdcardAndroiddatacom.maxmpz.audioplayeralbumart, though yes, option to save directly into song#39;s folder may be useful - I#39;ll think about that. As for embeding into the song itself, it won#39;t work for auto downloader as album art is per album, which can contain many songs, and re-writing 4-6mb of typical song multiply to 15 songs of typical album will cause issues on typical android phone (sound skipping) as such skips already can appear when about 100kb of data is saved to flash, esp. on Samsungs.];[I can see this as being an issue. However, it could be an option to do it "offline" meaning whenever the user decides to activate the function or when the phone is not playing any songs ?];
fading when changing tracks	I really like the player, the best so far. I#39;d really love to see an option to turn on fading when changing tracks.

Are you sure? I really need it in order for the music to stop getting cut off when my car#39;s audio in senses it#39;s too quiet at the end of songs or between songs. Really annoying without crossfade.];[actually there was no option for that in 296, but there was fading for me, I don#39;t know how, because I#39;m aware that there was no fading option. in 325 the tracks change immediately, without fade. something must have been changed, because I use the same rom(same drivers) as with the previous version of this program. anyway I#39;d like to have that option in future updates.];[The "fading" actually depends on device (cpu) and track format. For slower cpus, bigger buffer is used and for some formats, bigger buffer is just required due to the big block size (.ape), thus changing track introduces small intermediate period with the "fading" - on fast device track is switched so fast you can#39;t hear this. I returned this behavior for slower devices already in dev builds and it will be in the next maintaince update on market. Thanks!];

browsing in folder mode	hi! this is nitpicking...but if you set sdcard:#092;music as your default music folder, then the music folder should not be shown as directory when opening the folder view, but only it#39;s files subfolders. because this is always an unnecessary click. thanks and greetings!		02 February 2011 - 09:29 AM	blubserl	[Thanks for request. This is done for consistency now, as if you have 2 such folders (music + musicfolders for example), they have to be displayed as 2 separate folders in the hierarchy view. The change in behavior for 1 root folder vs multiple can produce more questions from users, but I will think about adding some option for this.];
equalizer by genre	Hi. I have never understood why no player has implemented this (that I am aware of). If you can read genre from meta data, and you have custom and preset equalizer settings, I think it would be great if we could set the equalizer to change with each song based on the meta data genre. It would just have to read the meta data and change the equalizer before the song begins to play. A default genre could be used for any track that falls though the track (missing meta data or an odd genre). I shuffle through electronica, alternative, classical, classic rock and other stuff. I didn#39;t see it mentioned in the "todo" list of features. I got today#39;s build that says you can set the genre for each track, but I have not figured out how to do that, plus that seems like a lot of work.		31 January 2011 - 09:39 PM	bsg75	[This is a great idea, I hope it will be implemented somewhere in the next release. Or at least make it possible to set equalizer for folders, not just one song.];[Thanks for the request. This will be possible when PowerAMP custom library will be implemented (in PowerAMP v2.0). For PowerAMP 1 implementing per genreartistalbum etc presets is possible, but it will require too much queries to db per Library song played, introducing gaps and adding more overhead to the phone.];
output via phonevia bluetooth	SGS stock player has this option available natively.

I would definately buy then		02 February 2011 - 09:57 AM	gachax	[It auto-switches fine for me. If a stereo bluetooth device is connected, the audio plays via that. If a headphone is plugged in, the audio plays via that. Both of these methods auto-start when the device is connected, and PowerAMP auto-pauses when they are disconnected. Very intuitive to me. Otherwise, the noise (I#39;d hardly call it audio ) comes from the little speaker on the phone. Andre];

Since dsin(2pi*n*f*t)dt = 2pi*n*cos(2pi*n*f*t), the added signal is dependent from f and its amplitude is higher at high frequencies.		02 February 2011 - 12:50 PM	prophet	
find more of the same artistalbumgenre short cut	Hi! First post! I shuffle a lot, but every now and then when I stuble upon somthing that I really like I get the impulse to stay with that artistgenrealbum. Wouldn#39;t it be nice to be able to find that category of music (genreartistalbumfolder) maybe via some kind of long press or such and a context menu, without having to search and type or flick through menu hierarchy? The stock Galaxy S player can do it (long press album art) but has implemented it in a stupid way, since the short cut is not really that short because there#39;s an extra menu that you have to get passed: "serach in youtubegooglemedia library". Annoying when it pops up the hundredth time, and you, for the hundredth time press "library". BTW Thank you so much for the Poweramp player! Changed my life!		01 February 2011 - 10:58 AM	huheeje	
increse ffrw speed over time	When ff or rw#39;ing in long files (audiobooks or podcasts) the ffrw is too slow.

Or maybe even more, on my Samsung the winding gets just faster and faster. Or even better a Goto command - then Poweramp would really be perfect for both music and audiobooks...];[On all of my audio and video playback programs on my PC (and on my old WinMo phone) I set the cursor keys as #39;skip#39; and #39;jump#39; buttons for easy navigation of longer files. For example, #39;Skip#39; moves forward or backward by 10 seconds, while #39;Jump#39; moves by 1 minute. The actual times are configurable, but those settings work for me. The lack of a proper D-pad on Android is a real pain in this respect, but I have previously suggested that this feature could be very easily implemented via the trackpad - a left swipe to skip back 10 seconds (or whatever value the user has chosen), a right swipe for forward 10 seconds, and up and down swipes for longer jumps. This really simple feature would make general use of this program so much easier for me. Oh, and Max, do you have a timescale yet for adding the current press-and-hold functionality for fwdrwd onto the physical buttons on the headset cable too? Thanks again for all your hard work, Andre];[I will probably add additional step scaling as you described. Currently, PowerAMP doesn#39;t support ffrw commands for headsets, mostly because half of android devices+headset combinations can#39;t reliable process long presses.];

playlists - advanced mode	Greate work, thanks! Can I suggest a couple of very usefull features to add: 1. Ability to see, what playlist is the "now-playing" track ALREADY in, even in Shuffle-All tracks mode - right on the main player screen is even better. 2. Ability to excludedelete track from playlist in every mode 3. Multiple playlist selection while adding to a playlist (e.g. "Favorite" + "Hard-n-Heavy"), the same for excluding from the playlist. 4. Multiple songs selectiondeselection in playlist edit mode. 5. Auto-saving the playlists on the SD Card in own directory (copy of the system playlists) - in order not to lose the info after re-installing the ROM. Also interesting would be possibility to restore the saved playlists into a system data, making them available for other players. 6. Ability to RATE tracks while playing and ability to SORT and to create Playlists on this basis (e.g. "My 3 Stars" etc.) 7. If it#39;s possible to make sorting on Rating inside Playlist - would be PERFECT - so user won#39;t need to make playlist like "My favorite", "My very favorite", "My most favorite" and so on.. BR AndrewMe		24 January 2011 - 11:56 AM	AndrewMe	[1. can be done when playlists are played, though not for shuffle all, as shuffle all means "All Songs" are shuffled. 2. not sure what you mean by exclude, you can delete tracks from playlists now 3. you can add from one playlist to another to get a combined playlist 4. thanks for the request. 5. see #4 6. ratings are plannedthanks for the request 7. see #4 Thanks!];[1.

re-organize playlist files (and save custom eq settings)	I love creating playlists within the app (it#39;s very easy to do), but I#39;d love an option where I can change the order of the files (maybe an "edit" option by pressing the menu button within the playlist, then drag the files around). I tend to just add files to the playlist willy-nilly, and then I want them in a specific order (for a workout or commute or whatever). If I could just dump all my files into the playslist, then easily edit the order of the files within the app, that would be ideal.

disable lockscreen when i resume quickly	if the phone screen turns off but I quickly turn on again, Poweramp lockscreen appears.

info panel from tap on the album art	How about switching to the Info panel when taping on the album art in the main play display? This saves one click and is easier than hitting the relatively small info button in Menu .

genere artists album	Having used an iPod for years, I#39;m use to having the ability to select a Genre, and than seeing a listing of Artists who have been tagged as being of that Genre, and then a listing of the Albums by that Artist, once Artist is selected.

Thanks.		29 January 2011 - 04:01 PM	General Zod	[Thanks for the request, this was already requested and it#39;s in my todo list for v2.0. Though, there is no entity as artist or album on your sd card - you have separate songs with tags, some can have same artist tag - these will be considered as song by the same artist, but still, genre can be different for the various songs, meaning, multiple genres can have same artist inside (when this will be implemented).];
airtunes speakers (airport express)	Hi, Apple have recently integrated direct streaming to AirTunes Speakers for non iTunes installed devices I.e. iPad and iPhone. This is something that has sadly been missing for some time and there#39;s no longer the need to piggy back a mac or laptop etc to achieve streaming to remote speakers. Will a future update off such a feature, to be able to choose which speakers to push to? DLNA and iTunes Server for playing from local media devices would also be cool.		28 November 2010 - 12:16 AM	earsbleed	[Sorry but need to bump.];[In android, apps don#39;t have access to any hardware sound outputs at all. They can only output into some virtual sound device. Android on its turn routes that audio stream to the connected output device, which can be headset, BT audio or speakerphone. Application can ask to change that route, but it can#39;t do anything beyond that. As you understand, AirTunes speaker (or any other specific device) is not known by Android. If it AitTunes speaker can be connected as A2DP Bluetooth device, it can be recognized by Android and then PowerAMP will play on it.];[Bad news. Perhaps Google will incorporate the ability to stream to AirTunes on a future update.];
media scan, unlock screen, menu options	I’ve been playing with the Poweramp a lot lately and I love what I see. I do have some comments and observations that perhaps may make this great product even better, thanks for listening!- Media scan (a biiiiig deal)I have a 32G external SD with more than 8,000 tunes. This is a problem because Android automatically invokes Media Scan on every change on SD and on every Reset which forces long delay even if nothing was changed in the music folders. Poweramp has an option to skip its music folders from the external SD during Media Scan (great!) but it does not have an option to force that scan from within Poweramp. This is another problem because if I want that scan them to update the Library list then I need to change the Poweramp option and then reboot the phone – kind of a clunky process (unless I#39;m missing something). If I#39;m not missing anything then what about an ability to force Media scan from within Poweramp (from the main System Library panel?) for the folders that are explicitly disabled with the existing option? That would be huge! There is a general discussion on the XDA forum of that type of approach, here: http:forum.xda-dev... ... ?t=732462#- Swipe to Unlock Screen (very minor)I wonder why the unlock screen option for the locked screen widget does not work the way standard android unlock does: swipe to the right. I would prefer that default swipe with the widget instead of the two options that currently exists (tap to unlock or tap to get to the swipe). A minor detail really.- Menu (very minor)I wonder why Menu does not display items the way other apps do (like Menu on the Home screen) and instead uses these tiny buttons as part of the actual panel. I would prefer the “standard” way because it is easier to see and more of what I would expect. A minor detail really.- Previous suggestionsviewtopic.php?f=3t=664viewtopic.php?f=3t=656viewtopic.php?f=3t=653		29 January 2011 - 06:19 PM	mizius	[Thanks for the detailed requests. When developing PowerAMP folders subsystem, I was specifically oriented towards huge lists of the music (unfortunately, some parts of Android OS itself doesn#39;t handle large number of anything well, but at least I tried to minimize any limitations in PowerAMP). The current Library used in PowerAMP is the system library and it has a lot of issues, not just with scanning, but also with various tags, the database structure is not so optimal, etc. The solution for all that is the custom Library - custom media scanner (which already exists in PowerAMP, but it works for Folders only), custom optimized library database - PowerAMP v2.0 won#39;t use system media scanner and system media library at all. Of course, the best results will be when user disables media scanner for music in PowerAMP 2.0 (to avoid extra system scan for music folders). Re: Menu. The buttons are not so small, as padding and text are sensitive to presses - generally it#39;s comparable to other standard Android OS buttonscontrol sizes. The planned skin system for PowerAMP v2.0 will allow external skins to be installed, and I think I will release some "Android OS" skin, though it#39;s a bit boring, I think];[maxmpz - thanks so much for responding, much appreciated. See some comments below.Your improvements of the folder scanning into custom library over the Media scanner are impressive indeed and one of the key benefits of the app as far as I’m concerned – thank you for that! Regardless, I would like to see the above implemented at some point. For now I use Rescan Media Root app as an alternative to the above request as follows:To make sure that Media scan is never invoked automatically:- In Poweramp the following option must be turned OFF: Menu SETTINGS Advanced Folders Options No System Scan For Folders- In Android the following option must be turned ON: Home Menu Settings Applications Development USB debugging- In Rescan Media Root the following option must be turned ON: Menu Select options Disable scanner on quitTo perform Media scan so that it builds system library that will be visible by Poweramp or any other android app:- Run Rescan Media Root and wait until Media scan is done (watch the status bar)- Exit with the back button and wait until Done message is displayedApp discussion: http:forum.xda-dev...ad.php?t=753294Great, thanks! But why not just use the same scheme as is the android default for the sake of consistency? I see that I was not clear. My issue is not the size of the button itself but the size of the label font – I just have difficulty reading such small fonts (especially while driving as I pointed out in other posts :geek:). Agree with the boring but being a software person myself I came to appreciate UI navigational consistency from the user perspective .];
custom equalizer settings	Yes, I#39;ve seen some comments on saving your own, custom equalizer settings, so sorry for the new thread. However, not only would it be great to save the custom settings, but to have given ones load automatically with a song would be even better. I know that#39;s probably asking a lot, but not all songs sound ideal with a given and fixed setting. Some need more bass, some less, for example. Anyway, the program is great, but, without being able to save eq settings, experimentation becomes a #39;hazard#39;. BTW I noticed a #39;being worked on#39; item that is supposed to show (I think) that saving EQ settings is...being worked on. However, I could not find reference to that in the item itself.

integration with samsung desk home app	Samsung provides a nice dock for the Galaxy S GT-I9000 (and the related variants like T-Mobile Variant). That dock connects to the phone only via mircoUSB but the dock itself does have an audio out on the back. When the phone is in the dock then the sound is channeled to that audio out (via microUSB somehow) so that you can have speakers connected there. In order to have that audio out option working one has to be on froyo 2.2 or higher, has to install the official Samsung Desk Home app (see the attachment), and has to enable a proper setting within that app. The idea of the app is to replace the default android home screen with a pre set functionality applicable to a phone in a dock used as an alarm clock, etc. (let’s not argue that – it works for that purpose)In that scenario, when I invoke AudioAMP and slide the phone into the dock then the screen switches to the Desk Home UI and the AudioAMP music is channeled to the external audio out as expected. But now I don’t have the AudioAMP UI to control the music (or access to the phone’s volume buttons which are blocked by the dock) so I need to hit the Desk Home Exit button (or Android Back) to get to the AudioAMP controls (Android Home button is tied to that Desk Home app in this case) . Unfortunately as soon as I exit Desk Home UI the music instantly switches to the phone speaker and stays that way until I switch back to the Home Desk UI (by hitting the Home button) in which case the music switches back to the dock audio out. You see how awkward this music flipping is.I tested the same scenario with the IG I-9000 stock music player and it does exactly the same when following the same scenario (exiting Home Desk to get to the player’s UI). However … the Home Desk app has a default icon for the stock player (the one in the middle) and when I use that to get to the player controls then the music continues to be channeled to the dock’s audio out – it never returns to the phone’s speaker. You see how nice this is.Soooooooo the question is: can AudioAMP provide integration with the Home Desk app the way that stock player does? – ideally by reusing the same player icon.In case it matters here’s what I have:- GT-I9000 unbranded and unlocked- Froyo 2.2.1 (JPY)- Home Desk rev 1.0 (rev 1.0.1 crashes on my phone)- dock bought in the US as an accessory for T969 Vibrant (T-Mobile) , but it’s the same as dock for GT-I9000BTW, there is also a related Desk Car app for an alternate Samsung dock meant for cars but I assume that there is no such issue since I don’t believe that that dock has an audio out – but I did not test it since I don’t have that dock.The dock:http:www.samsung.c... ...

I said there that Home button is tied to the Desk Home app – which is true except that I forgot about the long press press which brings up the Task Manager. That way one can go to the currently running Poweramp without disturbing the audio out – this is actually very good and solves the issue of loosing audio out . The only remaining item then is to provide integration to the AudioAMP via the Home Desk Music icon – but that by itself is not a high priority at all.];

browse albums by genre	Hi! I really would like to be able to browse albums by genre. Currently, when selecting genre in the library, I get a list of all SONGS from that genre. When listening to music, I usually first pick a genere and then an album. Most mobile players I used in the past years had this option. I was really surprised that the state-of-the-art Android music player doesn#39;t support this view.

disable bluetooth integration?	I run a BlueAnt S4 Bluetooth hands free speaker in my car for making and receiving calls. My problem is, I use my headphone jack on my DroidX to send music into my stereo. Whenever I play my music in Poweramp, it comes through my Bluetooth speaker instead of my headphone jack. I could turn off Bluetooth, but then I wouldn#39;t be able to use it to make calls etc. I have looked a bit, but have not found a setting in Poweramp that says, "don#39;t use Bluetooth". Any thoughts?		15 January 2011 - 05:34 PM	AGregory	[I have the same problem. You can go into your bluetooth settings on your phone and uncheck the option for media which will stop sending music to the bluetooth speakerphone however it will only remember this for one session and gets rechecked automatically the next time your devices pair. It would be great if Poweramp could have a control that wouldn#39;t bypass this. Something like "always send music through wired headset if available" option.];[Thanks for the request.

dedicated folderlibrary button	Hi, I#39;ve been testing Poweramp for a few days and I like what I hearsee so far. There is just one minor annoying thing: you have to press menu to go to the folders library browser. I#39;d like there to be a dedicated button on the player interface that takes me here, without having to hit the menu hardbutton. The htc and samsung default players both have this and for me this provides a more fluent workflow. Going to the library to select music is a too common action to be hidden behind the menu button (my gf couldn#39;t get music to play because she always forgets the thing exists) Also the buttons that appear when you press menu are very small. They#39;re quite hard to hit and I don#39;t even have thick fingers. It looks very nice, but I think I prefer the standard android menu popup just for ergonomics: these buttons are a lot larger and therefore easier to hit. Half the time I hit eq instead of folderlibary. Sorry for the long post. I#39;m really happy with this app and looking forward to what you come up with next. Keep up the good work!		19 January 2011 - 12:53 PM	Kyran	[Agreed.];[You can press the mini display with titlealbumartist info to go to current selected list, and long press on the same mini display to go to the "parent" list (i.e. to folders, if song is from folder).

PowerAMP UI is hdpi rendered, is looks "smaller", actual size of elements in pixel on screen is the same as other standard elements on Android platform.

preset eq to compensate for dynamic in ears	G#39;day, Many low to mid range earphones (canal phones) based on Dynamic drivers have a frequency response that lacks bass has a peak at the resonant frequency (for most about 3 KHz with Dynamic drivers) and then rolls off steadily beyond 10-11 KHz. A preset that approximates the inverse of the average response curve would be good.

shuffling folders	Hi, This is really great app, however there is one feature that i would like to see in the future releases. The feature that I have in mind is shuffling entire folders, *NOT* the songs inside the folders. For example when the playlist would reach the last song of a currently playing folder, it would randomly select the next folder and play all songs in that folder. An example of the this feature can be found on foobar2000 audio player. You can try this feature inside foobar2000 by selecting from menu Playback-Order-Shuffle(folders). Of course there is no need to implement this feature on main UI the of Poweramp(It would be nice though if implemented). It could just activated from settings menu, for example with a checkbox(Shuffle folders). Anyway, Poweramp is really great for being very feature rich and FAST(please keep it that way ). Thanks!

not detecting .alc or .flc (alac and flac) files	Awesome product, works incredibly (sorry, had to do it) well on my DInc. The only real issue I have been experiencing is, when SqueezeCommander downloads files off my squeezecenter server, it#39;s changing the file extension from alacflac (or m4a) to .flc or .alc. These file types are apparently ignored by your folder scanner (if i open them from astro they play in Poweramp), however if I manually change the extension then re-scan, the folder immediately pops up. This is a pain since apparently astro can#39;t do it (and I change out music using squeeze a lot!). Naturally, I#39;ll be opening a bug with the author of SqueezeCommander as well, but in the meantime can you please add support for the .alc and .flc extensions?

optional playback engine?	Hi, I see elsewhere people have asked about support for other variants of WMA, and you#39;ve commented that you#39;ll never be able to support DRM. I#39;ve just got a Galaxy Tab, and was really pleased to see how well its support for DRM works. I was also pleased to see that it had been implemented in a way that meant it works in other music players (that wasn#39;t the case on an Archos device I have which also implements WMA DRM). However, I was disappointed to find that that doesn#39;t extend to Poweramp. I realise that that#39;s a tradeoff against the fact that Poweramp supports other formats (e.g. FLAC) that the device otherwise wouldn#39;t support, because it uses its own method for decoding the audio. Is there any possibility of you somehow allowing it to use the OS decoders in certain scenarios? Either where it detects that it just doesn#39;t support the format, or simply through a toggle in the settings? I realise that this would probably be complicated - and in particular certain functionality (equalizer maybe?) might depend on doing the decoding itself, but on the other hand it might give a number of gains (for instance, if Poweramp doesn#39;t support formats that the device#39;s native player supports, that#39;ll encourage people to stick with their native player) Do you think it#39;s totally out of the question, or something you might be able to add onto the feature request list? Thanks Rob		12 January 2011 - 08:44 AM	RobL	[In Androids below 2.3 there is no way to get sound stream back to application to produce processing on it (equalizepreamp it). Basically, almost all Android music players are just UI, which send playpauseetc commands to system media process which actually plays the songs. While it#39;s possible to add support for that media service to PowerAMP too, it won#39;t apply equalizer to it and this is much harder to explain to user than inability to play appropriate wma variants. Also, legally playing DRM WMA will require payment to MS, most of users won#39;t accept raised price for the app (like in 20-30 range)...];[Do you mean legally playing it using your own engine? Presumably since, as you say, most music players are just controlling the android engine that doesn#39;t require licencing? If (and I realise this might be a big if) it#39;s possible for you to identify formats that you can#39;t play but which the OS can, I#39;d personally have thought that people would live with the fact that you get a lower quality of user experience (i.e. minus equalizer) when playing it back. Of course, I realise that#39;s simplifying the implementation anyway.];[WMA is not supported by "stock" android, it#39;s supported by the specific vendors (e.g. HTC, Samsung), various vendors can support various formats on their will.];[no, I realise that.

re: todo listfeatures in progress	Hi, I#39;m glad to see that ratings is coming with version 2!! Have you any plans yet with regards to the mechanism with which Poweramp#39;s users will synchronize their ratings with their PC? If not, I have an idea to propose: Suggestion of a Ratings and Synchronization System: You don#39;t have to do like Apple or DoubleTwist and write your own PC Music Player to manage ratings, playlists and synchronize with the phone. You can go with Songbird which as far as I#39;m concerned is far superior to either doubleTwist or iTunes. It has the ability to export and import iTunes Libraries. It takes extensions that would be quite straight forward to write. You could just write a Songbird extension that synchronizes Music Files, Pictures, Videos, Playlists and Ratings with Poweramp on the Android Phone. The ratings can be stored in an SQLite file on the phone. There are extensions that are already on the Songbird market that are open source that you can potentially modify the code to come up with 80 of the code you need (if you accept the terms of GPL). The first is called FolderSync, it syncronizes Media Files with directories that the users already specify. It also writes m3u playlists. The second is called RatingFile, it exports the Ratings of the Songbird library to a srf file. Potentially, you can combine these two codes to come with something specifically tailored for Poweramp. Songbird is available on Windows, Mac and a Linux version of Songbird called Nightingale is in the works.		13 December 2010 - 01:35 AM	monkeyman	[Thanks for the request.];
auto playlist	Hi! I would like to suggest a feature I#39;ve seen in a PC application. I had a program that was connected to last.fm, and when you were listening to a playlist and you reached the end, it searched in last.fm similar artistssongs af the playlist, and played them if they were in your library. I think it is a very good way to generate auto playlists, because you don#39;t have to configure settings about type of music, type of artist, etc... you only add some songs you want to listen, and last.fm, which has a very good random playlist generator, helps the program.

backwards shuffle	I#39;m missing a feature I used a lot from my iPod, where you could pick a song and then hit previous track and it would shuffle backwards, but then play the song you selected.Example:shuffle mode onselect song GpreviouspreviouspreviousSong C playsSong X playsSong Y playsSong G playsthe point being that if you wanted, you could pick a song you like, and then check in front and behind it to make sure the shuffled playlist was going to contain songs you#39;re in the mood for		22 December 2010 - 07:55 PM	hyped	[In PowerAMP, when you shuffle, the currently selected list is taken and items are randomly reordered in, and the playing starts from the first entry in that list. Thus, there is no previous song, physically in this list when the first track from this random shuffled list is selected. But I think it#39;s possible to navigate (wrap) to the end of the list, the same way it wraps when Repeat Folder mode is enabled. Not sure if this matches ipod shuffling though. Also, if this will be implemented, it will work only if one of the Repeat modes is enabled. Thanks for idea.];
integration with voice actions	I believe that Google Voice Actions supports the "listen to" voice action.. would it be possible to add support for that?		25 December 2010 - 06:24 PM	Timmy Fox	[viewtopic.php?f=3t=116p=2340hilit=voice+search#p2340 Thanks!];
folder view	Hi there, I was wondering if the #39;Folders#39; View can be set to display the folders as they appear in the actual SD Card and allow users to #39;drill#39; down the folder structure to the actual song files? Right now, all the folders appear in one long list, which makes no sense. I#39;ll see things like CD1, CD2, The Collection etc. This means nothing since I have created multiple CD1 CD2 folders for many artists, under their own folders. Thanks!

a more universal, minimalistic version of the widget?	hello,would it be possible to implement a more minimalistic version of the widget? what I mean specifically is a plain text display of artistsongtitle with a set of simple monochrome buttons. it could have a single-color background with an adjustable degree of transparency. basically, what I mean is something along the lines of the popular clockr widget:I have recently made myself a nice setup with launcher pro. it is very minimalistic and in a black-green color scheme. a semi-transparent widget would fit in with any theme out there.thanks and keep up the good work		29 December 2010 - 11:16 AM	peterabelard	[Thanks for the request.];
disable pause on calls	Is it possible to disable the pause feature during calls? I use an odd setup, BT headset for calls and a BT car stereo that has seperate controls for audio and media. Driving 10 or 12 hours a day every day this pausing everytime I get a call is getting annoying, would rather be able to have the music still playing thru the car stereo and talk on the headset, IF this is possible.

headset options needed for bluetooth	I love the options available for wired headsets, but how about adding them for bluetooth headsets as well?

It is mainly because the headphone amp only gets its voltage consumption from the battery of the car.

viewing playcount in library for podcast support?????	This may be better left till there is better podcast support, however it would be nice to be able to distinguish between an unplayed and a played podcast within a playlist. Heres a usage example. I use iTunes to manage and download my podcasts. I have smart playlists setup to include podcasts with a 0 playcount. I use iSyncrWifi to sync my playlists to my phone. I have Poweramp set to scrobble using Simple LastFm Say for example I have 10 podcasts in a playlist and I start to work my way through them on my phone during the day, unless I remember manually through the day which i have listened to, I have no way of seeing in Poweramp which podcasts are still to be played. The only way is to wait until I am home again and resync to PC with iSyncrWifi and see which ones automatically disappear. Not sure how it could be implemented, but perhaps an option to slightly change the background color of the item when viewing playlistlibrary based on playcount =0. I dont know if it is an itunes specific thing to have all podcasts given the Genre of "Podcast" but it could limit it to those to avoid doing it for all songs. Although to be honest I#39;d be quite happy with just having an option to turn it on or off and have it apply to all songs. I guess this would need some careful thought so as to not mess things up.		11 January 2011 - 11:04 PM	zimma	[Thanks for the request and the idea.];
stuff for using a galaxy tab like a car stereo	Hi, I sent this as a PM on another board to the author of this app but then I found this forum so I#39;ll post it here too.

I have a charger connected to the cigarette lighter. It#39;s not powered when the car is off.

shuffle by artist (disregarding album)	Hi, I think it would be great to have an extra shuffle option which shuffles by currently playing Artist only, disregarding albums.

No need to enhance the animation visuals I think they look great now, would just be a bit faster depending on the speed of the flick.];[Hi, I agree.

separate eq for lr channels	I#39;ve been checking out Poweramp for a little while and find that it works very nicely. The equalizer in particular is a benefit for me as I am somewhat hearing impaired and can boost the higher frequencies to help compensate. However, the hearing loss is not the same in both ears. I use behind the ear type hearing aids, so lightweight, on the ear headphones don#39;t really put much sound through them. It occurs to me that separate LR EQ (and volume) would permit adjusting music to each ear as needed. This should be in addition to the overall equalizer. I posted a query on the AC site asking if anyone knew of such a music player out there, but got exactly zero responses. If there aren#39;t any music apps like this out there, it might be worthwhile to consider developing one. Consider that there are probably several million people like me out there who would love to be able to optimize how they hear music. Even people with #39;normal#39; hearing may not hear the same in both ears and might benefit from this. Thanks. Curlyjim		28 December 2010 - 06:32 AM	curlyjim	[Thanks for the request.];

new year#39;s offer?	Hello everyone. First and foremost, Happy New Year to all! Now, I#39;ve been using this app for a few days and couldnt be more happy with it, I truly think its THE best player in the market today and I thoroughly congratulate its creator. But I must say that my current situation as a 3rd world country dweller doesent allow me to pay for the full app, sadly, the exchange rates here are far from convenient (around 1:5, or worse, depending on the day.). Now, dont get me wrong, Im not trying to beg, or anything like that. But ive noticed that some of the apps I use are getting new year#39;s discount, some 50, some 60, and there#39;s a couple that are even free for a few days (Awesome). And I was thinking that if Poweramp did a sale like this it could really push sales and get a lot of people to convert to it from other, lesser players. I know Ive been waiting for a chance to ditch my ugly ass and cheap player. Even if the disccount was for 50 and a couple of days it would still make a difference for the people who arent getting their sallaries in euros or dollars (no offense guys). I know I would spam the crap of many a friend#39;s inbox with the offer.

shuffle albumfolder	Very impressed with Poweramp app, works perfectly so far on HTC Desire, in particular love the EQ functionality. One thing needed to perfect it though, is adding shuffle by albumfolder. As an ex ipod user this is one thing I really miss, my ipod used to surprise me sometimes, and I now don#39;t want to have to choose what album I listen to every time. Unless I#39;m missing something as far as I can see Poweramp always shuffles by song, wherever I start shuffle from.

folder sorting by track name	Hello, I would like if you can have the "Folders" folder to be able to sort by track name. I’ve tried all of the sorting options but it only reads the songs in alphabetical order by Artist name. Again this is in the “Folders” folder and not in “Library” folder. I don’t like using the “Library” folder because it reads program files plays some of my games soundboards, after a few stops playing because it “played to many incorrect files.” If you can make that happen, or maybe have us pick the folders to read from in “Library” folder so we don’t get files from games, ie. gameloft games.Thank You,Sener		29 December 2010 - 09:19 PM	Sener	[Your problem is presumably that your filenames are in the format "artist - title", so that#39;s how the system sorts the list.I have my files named using "title - artist" which always makes more sense to me as I already have a folder for each album anyway, so I don#39;t need the artist name shown first. You could also use "trackno - title - artist" if you want albums to play in the original running order.If you do want to change all your filenames globally, just use a program like TagScanner (free from http:www.xdlab.ru) which does a great job of updating MP3 tags from filenames or vice versa (batch mode renaming from tag contents is great). You can even add album art, etc. Just watch out for any playlists you may have, as they will break if you change the filenames (but if you name the files using tracknumber first, you don#39;t need album playlists anyway).Andre];

It will be improved overtime (both ffmpeg improves and PowerAMP#39;s fork of ffmpeg). Thanks!];[Thanks for your answer. I coded with Windows Media Player on my PC (W7 32bits). What should I have done ? Sorry but i#39;m not smart enough to understand what ffmpeg is. You bet I did#39;nt get the end ! In a nutshell, can I do anything other than wait or transcode to WMA high bit rate ? Merci !];[I#39;m not sure what all the different WMA file formats are. I#39;ve seen references to Lossless, Professional, Standard, Variable-Bit Rate, Constant-Bit Rate, etc. It seems to be based on which version of Windows Media you are using. The file format that you are using can be set via the rip or copy music options dialog. In general, the most widely supported file format is MPEG3 (.mp3), as just about every app includes a codec that can translate MPEG3 files. Unfortunately, since MPEG3 uses constant-bit rate sampling, and everyone tends err on the higher-quality side when selecting a bit rate, you end up with rather large files (e.g. 6 MB per song). The Windows Media 9 Variable Bit Rate (.wma) file format is backward-compatible with older codecs, so most apps that support .wma files can translate these (including the codec in Poweramp). The nice thing about VBR files is they are much smaller (e.g. 1-2 MB per song) without giving up on sound quality. This might be a good choice for you, however it is not as universally supported as MPEG3. For example, I have tried other apps that could play the VBR WMA files, but could not calculate the track time correctly for these songs. As with anything, the newer, more advanced technologies will not be as widely supported as the older ones. You need to choose your own least-common denominator for balancing functionality and support. Using the latest file-format option in the latest Windows Media Pro version is probably only a good idea if you are only ever going to use Windows Media to play your music. HTH!];[Stand, thanks for you description. Next PowerAMP update will include better support for wma pro encoded files (on NEON enabled devices only) and special optimized wma v1v2 codecs for non-NEON devices (like htc herowildfire).];

switch gestures over album art	Please could you add an option under #39;gestures over album art#39; to swap the direction, I#39;d prefer leftright to change folder and updown to change track!		22 December 2010 - 05:04 PM	mamoulian	[Thanks for the request. While it#39;s possible to add such option, the album art animation direction will be in reverse to your swipe. Is this ok for you?];[Thanks for the reply! You mean when swiping updown to change tracks if you#39;ve got #39;Album Art Animation#39; set to #39;Always#39;? Personally that wouldn#39;t bother me because I#39;ve got it set to #39;If album changed#39;. When you swipe from right-to-left, the #39;next#39; album cover will animate from right-to-left, that seems natural and correct to me, like you#39;re flipping CD covers in a jukebox.

manual advance to the next song	Please add a feature to manually advance to the next song. Presently, after a song is finished playing the player automatically starts playing the next song (or the same song if in auto-repeat mode).

wake phone etc. on headset connect	Please consider adding a couple of options alongside the #39;Resume on Headset Connect#39; option: [] wake phone (to unlock screen, where widget is) [] unlock phone [] bring the app to the front I think you should be able to individually check all of these on and off regardless of the others, for example if the screen is off I might want the phone to wake so I can see the lockscreen widget but not start playing the song automatically... then if the screen is already on I might want the app to pop to the front. Someone else might want the phone to wake, unlock and bring the app to the front. Having said that I think unlock implies wake :-)		22 December 2010 - 05:00 PM	mamoulian	[Thanks for the request.];
remember last song position	Any chance the player can remember the last song position? I listen to podcasts, and every time I switch songs and them come back to the podcast or the player is turned off it starts the audio file at the beginning. For podcasts that are a few hours long this is a major problem of having to find the last position I was listening. Thanks! Brian briantidmoregmail.com		15 December 2010 - 08:19 PM	briantidmore	[Thanks for the request. PowerAMP always had the ability to save last songposition. There were some report that on some phones+android versions it wasn#39;t the case, but as far as I know, latest builds (295+) are free from this problem. Unfortunately I was never able to reproduce it locally (probably, because my test phones are "fresh", like after factory reset, so there is no any possible interference from other software).];[I don#39;t find PowerAMP remembers play positions for audio files either. It remembers the current file and position if you exit and restart the player, which is usually all I need, but if I play another track in the meantime and then return to the first one, it starts the track at the beginning again. Is it meant to remember the last-played location for every file?

There will be audiobookpodcast support enhancements in PowerAMP, though.];[I use Poweramp to listen to mp3 audiobooks and I would like to see a feature where the program remembers the exact position within a file so that I can continue listening the next time from the same point.

Looks like my trial period just ended as I was trying to confirm some of the playlist features so I can#39;t confirm but if this had Smart playlist support I could effectively retire my iPod. I#39;m a podcast junkie and the only way to keep on top of them is a combination of many smart playlists feeding off of each other. This is assuming remember song position was functioning. I can#39;t confirm some of these details due to the trial expiring so chances are I won#39;t buy without further testing. Seems like a good app though. Was there video file support? Thanks];

will there ever be video support?	After seeing how active and supportive you are (along with the quality of the app, of course), I am going to buy the app anyway. I was just wondering if there will ever be video support. That would complete the app for me. Oh, and when do you think you will be releasing 2.0?		19 December 2010 - 06:38 PM	Bold	[For PowerAMP - no. It#39;s music player and focused on music quality heavily.

media volume on headset (auto)	Hello, is it possible to make the media volume automatic to 100 when a headset is connectet (wiredbluetooth)? Or a setting for a volumelevel only for Poweramp and not the system volume? My media phone is always on 30 and i use a bluetooth headset with Poweramp. When i use Poweramp i must manually set the volume to 100 on the telephone and later back to 30 (on 100 is the volume to loud in games *g*).

lockscreen large widget	Hi, I#39;m finally using this lockscreen with the big widget since it doesn#39;t conflict with trackball to unlock when I#39;m not playing music. What I wanted to request as a feature would be that I noticed you can use the trackball point and click to interact with the buttons on the screen (maybe an option to disable if people are pressing by accident too much?) so since I use the trackball to wake the device, my usual next action is to click again to unlock, but the default placement for the trackball is on the playpause, so this ends up pausing the playback. What I wanted to request was if you could place the default location on the unlock button, so that for me (and any users using CM or a trackball to unlock mod) a double click on the trackball would wake and unlock even while playing music and using the lockscreen. Thanks! Adolfo		17 December 2010 - 08:46 PM	Adolfo	[Thanks for the feedbackrequest. Technically there is no problem to focus the unlock button by default. Btw, how do you wake up your phone with trackball? Some custom rom?];[Yeah, I hesitated at first because I thought it would wake up by accident but that hardly ever happens, and now I#39;m just so used to holding my N1and double clicking the trackball with my thumb (to skip the lockscreen) that I miss this function when playing music. I#39;m using CM 6.1 (soon 7 for gingerbread) for Nexus one, and I have come to like so many features like long-press volume keys to simulate headset controls, etc.];
respond to headset buttons needs another option	Need a option to respond to headset buttons only when player is active. Every time I use Poweramp I have to click the setting for "Respond to Headset Buttons" and then disable it when I get done using it. I use other audio players for podcasts, audiobooks and recorded radio programs and none of them take over the controls like Poweramp. One of my other players has a option to "only override when player is active" and the others just do it automatically. If Poweramp bookmarked podcasts, audiobooks and radio talk shows then it would be the only player needed but since I need several I need to control which player responds to bluetooth controls. Changing settings every time Poweramp is used is a nuisance.		19 December 2010 - 08:58 AM	Crummy	[Thanks for the request. On Android 2.2 the last player which played something will respond to the headset buttons. As for 2.1, this is controlled by player settings, but PowerAMP will go inactive in 30 seconds of idle, meaning it won#39;t be started by headset until the app started, if this option is implemented.];[Thanks for the response. Sounds like 2.2 is the best option. I wish Motorola and my carrier would hurry up and move me to 2.2. Not ready to install 2.2 on my own but getting close. I can suffer through manually setting Poweramp to respond until I get 2.2. Makes it easier when you know a fix is coming soon. Thanks again.];
forward button	Great player, love it. Great recent update. This is probably one of those #39;niche#39; features, but I used to use a windows mobile player called nitrogen. You could set it so when you pressed the skip button, the album art and song title changed to the next song, but didn#39;t actually start playing it until you pressed the play button. If you left the new album art and song title up after pressing the skip button, when the current song playing finished, it would play the song you left on the screen. It was particularly useful when you were shuffling all songs, you could kind of skip through the shuffle and choose the next song you wanted to hear, but the shuffle kind of worked as #39;suggesting#39; the next song as you skipped through. Hopefully that makes sense. I always thought that was a great a feature and had never seen it anywhere else (and have never seen it since). I have no experience with coding or programming, so I have no idea how hard this would be - but the nitrogen player was pretty simple, so I would guess it#39;s not that hard. Anyway, thought I#39;d throw it out there, again great player, can#39;t wait for the update that includes hierarchical folders and a now playing queue!!		18 December 2010 - 06:39 PM	thecolonel20	[Thanks for the request.];

Option to customize actions for hardware buttons is planned, but it will only work for the buttons which are recognized by android.];
quick library context switching from player activity	I love that Poweramp remembers the library context I#39;m currently in and selects the next song accordingly. The only thing I#39;m missing is a way to quickly change to a different context from the player activity. My proposal in an example: 1. The user wants to play Reggae 2. He navigates to Genres-Reggae and selects a song 3. After a couple of minutes a Bob Marley song starts playing 4. The user decides that he now only wants the album of the current song to be played, not all the Reggae songs in his library. 5. He long presses on the cover art 6. A categories dialog appears with the options "Artist, Album, Genre, Folder" 7. He selects "Album" 8. The dialog closes and Poweramp internally changes the playback context to the album, without changing the current activity 9. A notification appears on the screen to confirm the selection 10. By clicking on "" the user can now skip through all songs of the current album 11. Clicking the mini info display will open the library activity with the list of songs of the current album I think this feature would greatly increase the comfort and speed of jumping between different categories in a big library.		18 December 2010 - 01:54 PM	RomD	[Thanks for the request. Album art long press is already reserved for album art operations, I think long click on mini-display would better fit such feature.];
playlist shuffle	First I#39;d like to really like to thank you for this awesome. Its made me love listening to music on my phone. I#39;ve been using it instead of my PC now. Amazing app, keep up the good work (please ). It seems I can#39;t shuffle within a playist, only within an album. If i click shuffle all while listening to a playlist, it plays all my songs (shuffled). Is there a way to treat a playlist as an album, and have the shuffle album function work for playlists?. Thank you (also, is there a way to disable volume change from turning the screen on if i#39;m using the widget)		16 December 2010 - 08:25 PM	basata	[Thanks for the request. Just keep pressing SHUFFLE until you see Shuffle Current Playlist mode. You can also long press SHUFFLE button for all available shuffle mode (build 295+). Note, that modes are context sensitive - i.e. they depend on what selection is currently played (folderalbumartistgenreplaylist). The screen on issue AFAIK happens only on Samsungs. The only possible workaround for that is reduced screen timeout - this one is implemented.];[Thanks for the response It worked like you said it would];

ability to keep screen on	Great job with the option to keep screen on, but could you enhance it further by making it keep screen on even when you have only the widget playing and not the whole app open?

Any chance of these happening?		16 December 2010 - 07:33 PM	zephyron	[Thanks for the feedbackrequest. It#39;s possible for Lock screen widget, but not for Home screen with widgets.];
album length, most played amp; maybe...	First of all, thank you Poweramp guys for making EASILY the best music player in the world, it has everything a man could ever want. And the fact I can simultaneously look at song lyrics from a tag and play a song blows my mind. Now there are just a couple of small things I miss from my Nokia#39;s music player: The album length ( basically the overall length of any library entry there is (artist, playlist, all songs...) "most played" playlist that practically counts every time you play a song and keeps track of what are your most "favorite" songs. What would be ¨¹ber-shm¨¹ber cool would be a real counter next to every song you play that says how many times you have played it. Now my third wish sounds crazy, not even nokia has this, but imagine how cool this would be: a smaller timeline that shows how far along you are on the album! So when you listen to a song and it#39;s in about 3:23 of 5:00, you can see another timeline that says 13:01 of 43:51 because it#39;s the fourth song on the album or whatever.

ability to run in background amp; auto resume after phone call	Dear Developer , i am using a HTC G1Dream with Rooted Android 2.2 , CyanogenMod 6.0.0-DS , Build FRF91 . using the paid verion of this software , while its a great application , but it lacks the below basic feature , i really hope its not a BIG deal for the developer to include the below features 1) Auto remue of playing MP3 songs while enjoying music via headphones , if we recive any phone call , the player will stop . Again i have take the phone out of my pocket and start playing . It will be very good if it can resume after the phone call was ended 2) When we start this application , while its playing , if we go to home page we lock the screen manually the mp3 player stops . it doesnt play in the back ground . however , its good that , if the screen locks automatically after the wait timer , it still continues to play . I hope the app can be imporved to continue playing in background even if we go to home page we lock the screen manually . Hope to have a update on this soon . Cheers		14 December 2010 - 08:49 AM	pvsrnaidu	[Thanks for the request. 1. PowerAMP does resume after the call (if it was paused by the call and if headset wasn#39;t disconnected). If it doesn#39;t happen for you, it#39;s probably the ROM issue. 2. PowerAMP does play in the background. It will play until songs list is complete (if not set to repeat), or until paused by widgetheadsetfrom ui or until being killed by something else (e.g. task killer). If it doesn#39;t work for you in the background, see #1];[Hi , thanks for reply , but as i mentioned the 2 features works well with application " MP3 music folder " . so its hard to accept as rom problem. Thanks];[PowerAMP is not MP3 music folder, so you can#39;t expect same issues (or non-issues) from these applications. If you can, you can try to temporarily install official update (if there is any 2.1+ for g1) and check if PowerAMP works there. As for this type of phones, PowerAMP is tested on HTC Hero and HTC Wildfire (these are closest in hardware to g1 from phones I have in my phone test set). Thanks.];
track ordering by id tag file number in folder view	Unless I have misunderstood something (which is far from impossible), it seems to me that when viewing the contents of an album in Library view, the tracks are ordered correctly on the basis of the ID3 track number tag. If viewing the contents of the same album in Folder view, however, the tracks can only be viewed in the correct order if the files in that folder are named are named to include the track number. Is that correct? So, if I name my tracks like this: 01ThisTrack 02 AnotherTrack 03MoreTracks ...then the Folder view can display and play them in the correct order. If I name my tracks like this, however (and only keep the track number in the ID3 tag): ThisTrack AnotherTrack MoreTracks ...then the Folder view will display my tracks in alphabetical order: AnotherTrack MoreTracks ThisTrack (My personal feeling is that track numbers, album and artist name, etc, should live in the mp3 file metadata (ID3 tag) rather than existing as part of the file name. I know this is an idealogical view that is somewhat divisive - but I know I#39;m not alone in managing my mp3 collection like this! I digress...) I think I understand some of the reasons behind this approach to Folders. For example, I imagine that not all file formats handled by Poweramp have ID3 tags. And I know that the current approach makes it easy to make custom compilations that play in the intended order by simply renaming the files. Nevertheless, I would love to have the flexibility to ask Poweramp to order Folder mp3 tracks on the basis of ID3 tags rather than the numerical ordering of file names. This would enable users like me to have all the Poweramp benefits of Folder navigation (not to mention the excellent gapless playback), without having to rename every mp3 file to include the track number. Hooray! So how about it? -Matthew		15 December 2010 - 04:02 PM	mathieu	[Thanks for the detailed description. PowerAMP uses pure tag based sortings for Library lists and pure filename based sortings for Folders list. PowerAMP doesn#39;t prescan all files for tags in Folders mode. To make sorting by tags available in Folders, complete tag prescan is needed and I try to avoid that.];
option to change default between folderslibrary	Hi, it would be nice to have an option in the settings so that you would choose when pressing the "FoldersLib" button which of Folders or library views showed up.

folderlibraryplaylist button on main screen	Love this app! One addition that would make this perfect is easier access to the folderlibraryplaylist screen. Currently from the main player screen you have to press menufolderartist or playlist (all on the left hand side of the screen which makes it difficult to reach when using one hand on some of the larger screens like my EVO). This is 3 key presses which seems alot for me considering I just want to switch artist or playlist. A single small button on the right hand side of the screen could take you there with 1 press and allow for switching album, artist, song, playlist with one hand(essential for driving),the repeat button could be resized smaller(similiar size to eqpre buttons) and the new button could be placed next to repeat button. Or the repeat AND shuffle button could be resized smaller and placed next to each other on the left side of screen, the new folderplaylist button could be on the right. I understand the need for a clean looking interface but this change(the addition of a single button) would be huge for useability! Please? Pretty please?!!! PS it would also be nice if there was an add new playlist selection on the playlist screen(would eliminate 2 keystrokes).		08 December 2010 - 05:35 PM	mikebz5	[Thanks for the feedback and detailed request.

quot;change album artquot; option	Marvellous app, my friend Just one suggestion. I#39;ve used almost every alternative out there, and yours seems to be the most accurate when it comes to downloading album art. It does screw up occasionally tho and it would be nice if there was a "Change album art" option in the "Info" panel so it skips to the next choice there is. It will also be useful for songs that initially had a wrong one. Do you think it#39;s possible?		13 December 2010 - 04:54 AM	bahkata	[Thanks for the feedbackrequest.

auto folder scan?	I#39;d like to request an "auto folder scan" option. I often sync my phone#39;s music folder with new tunes every morning, and it would be really nice to have Poweramp just automatically scan the folders to pick up the new files. Perhaps every time Poweramp starts it could do a "slow background" scan - that way it would be unobtrusive. Or maybe set up an auto scan time each day. Or how about an interval timeout (auto scan if it#39;s been X hours since the last scan, etc.)?		10 December 2010 - 12:17 AM	Software_Samurai	[Thanks for the request. PowerAMP (re)scans sd-card files for its Folders list when sd card is mounted. Do you use some sync approach which doesn#39;t involve sd card mounting? If so, can you reference this methodgive a link to app?];[Ah, yes, I#39;m using PCFileSync. (http:www.appbrain....org.pcfilesync)];[Thanks, I#39;ll try this app and check is something can be done about that.];[I sync my files using a PC-based folder sync program (wireless file access is achieved using a small FTP server running on the droid). So my updated music files (podcasts mainly) get synced in the background without any real notification to the phone. At the moment, I go into PowerAMP#39;s settings and press the Rescan Folders button whenever I remember. I guess for me, an option to automatically rescan folders whenever I manually start PowerAMP would be a great one (it only takes 1.5 seconds to scan, I can live with that). Probably not worth the re-scan occuring when the program wakes itself up in the background when headphones are attached, only when the main interface is loaded. Andre];[Yes, I think this can be added as an option. Thanks!];
folders	My official language is portuguese, but ill try to say what i want a sugestion.... I made some folders on my pc and transfer them to my android... for example... a Did a folder "METAl", inside this folder a did another folders like "Iron Maiden"... Black Sabbath" and inside of these i made folder with the albuns name.... Inside the folder "Rock" i did another folders .... ... .. But on Poweramp when I want to select my folders.... i cant select all the folder "metal" to play on shuffle.... the program goes directly to the folders of the albuns... like in "mortyplayer" we should have an option to search the folders on sdcard but your player is much better.... it would be perfect for me with this option ty		10 December 2010 - 05:53 PM	Nune	[This is planned (viewtopic.php?f=1t=172) Thanks!];
genius playlist-like feature	Hello! I don#39;t know if people have already asked for this feature, or if it would entail too much work, but is it possible to make a playlist maker similar to that of genius on Apple devices?

please do it :)	it would be just greatly great if you guys can do this its just an idea let me give u a senerio lets say i am playing a game and i want to skip this certain song so i have 1. go back to the homescreen 2. drop the notification and click on power amp icon or just tap the power amp icon on the home screen 3. tap the next button on power amp 4. go back to the homescreen 5. resume the game instead of this long procedure if you guys could just implement the play pause next back button in the recent apps if your not getting what i am saying here is a senerio again i am playing my game and want to skip a song so i just press and hold the home button as the recent apps pops up and there is it the play pause next and back music control buttons this would be great if you guys could do it or just even put this in the notification drop down		10 December 2010 - 03:09 AM	s44suman	[It#39;s not possible to integrateembed anything into the places where Android OS doesn#39;t allow (that would a huge security hole).

notification window	I think a great feature to add would be the ability to change songs from the drop down notification window because when your texting or doing something else it really sucks to have to go back to the player to skip a song if you could get back playpause and forward it would be more than worth paying for		03 November 2010 - 02:07 AM	piry525	[Thanks for the request.

song fast forwardrewind long press nextprev. title	It would be great if it is possible to play fast forward (rewind) by long-pressing the nextprevios title buttons - especially for headset users (I¡äam using Sennheiser MM450). Regarding bluetooth and sound quality you find many complaints regarding bitpool size of 32 which is used by android and it is not possible to change it in a config file (as possible on other OS). Additionally i have a special request: It would be fantastic if can find a way to increase the BT audio quality.

skip song with long press on volume +-	It would be nice if we could skip song by long-pressing Volume + for next song, or Volume - for previous song. Especially while the screen is off.

I had hardware a D-Pad on that, and I had that set so the left and right buttons skipped fwdback by 15 seconds per press. I sorely miss that ability for quick replay of something I missed, or to quickly skip past adverts in a podcast. The slider bar is pretty-much impossible to use for such fine control, and even fast-forwardfast-reverse buttons wouldn#39;t help much as they too would be somewhat coarse and unpredictable.Any chance this could be added as a simple trackpad option?Andre];
sleepmode	Sleepmode timer sets the time in minutes (or even hours) before playerphone turns off. Like that in any TV-set. I believe it would be useful to use this feature while you are listening to music in bed.		03 December 2010 - 08:45 PM	barser	[I#39;d actually prefer a subtle variant, which would be an auto-off mode rather than a specific sleep timer button.i.e. a Settings option to always turn the player off after a set period of inactivity from the user (suggest options of something like 15, 30, 45, 60, 90 or 120 mins). On my previous phone, I always had a 1 hour inactivity timer set in the music player.Any activity in the meantime (volume change, touch the screen, pauseplay, etc) would reset the counter if you want to continue listening. That way, if I still can#39;t get to sleep it doesn#39;t turn off on me anyway, LOL.Andre];[Good idea Andre. This feature would be welcomed by me.];[Thanks for the request. Sleep timer is planned. As for idle based sleep timer - it can#39;t work reliable, unfortunately, as android doesn#39;t report about events happening in other apps (due to the security - you don#39;t want any app to spy on others). Basically, if such idle timer would be implemented, PowerAMP could go to sleep when user, for example, is browsing something or doing anything with the other apps. This, as you can understand, is barely desirable, so I#39;m not sure about that feature. It can be only done for screen OFF state (i.e. idle will tick only when screen is off) - screen onoff actions are broadcast ones and available for all apps.];[Actually having an auto-stop feature that only triggers while the screen is off would work perfectly for me. The screen times out to black after a minute or so anyway, so that already implies no other user activity and so it wouldn#39;t effect anything else. Any user interaction via the headset buttons in the meantime (which would not wake the screen) should be counted as user-activity as far as the idle countdown is concerned though. Nice and simple to implement that way too, I assume? Could that go on the to-do list? Andre];
replace default lock screen with pa lockscreen	I feel bad about being one of those whiny guys asking for more(especially when this app is worth every penny) but is it possible to get more Lock screen widgets?

You guys nailed it with this app. - Ry		08 December 2010 - 11:08 PM	doughishere	
sound enhancement	Hi. Though I am very happy with your product, it would be great if you can improve the sound for this player, especially the master volume. I want to get one of the high-end earphones (audio technica ATH-CM7-TI or anything along the line...) to get the profoundrich sound and I find your master volume is still not loud enough.. Also, there have been a number of comments about the sound being one of the weakness of your product (posted on the android market board by the korean users). Plus, eventhough your equalizer function is sophisticated enough to provide wide range of presets, it would be great to improve the sound quality of the raw music output itself if that is not too much trouble. I am well aware that you cannot provide everything, howevever, most people here use this prog. as a substitute for their mp3 player(myself for example), so enhancement in terms of the sound quality should be placed as one of the top-priorities for your upcoming updates... I know this is not an mp3 player, (maybe I#39;m being greedy) so you probably cannot get the same level of quality, but still, I am just expressing my humble opinion...hoping one day, my phone can truly replace mp3 player... Thank you for your hard work.		08 December 2010 - 05:56 PM	ElNAth	
no album art	I cant get album artwork for down load. I#39;ve change the setting and even switched to WIFI. But nothing. I am a bit conflicted. Dont know what to do. Ideas suggestions???		29 November 2010 - 12:46 AM	kscottneal	[Thanks for the report. Do you have album + artist tags in your songs? These are used for album art search (both are required).];[Where would that happen? (Settings....???) I#39;ve had album artwork show up in other programs so I dont know why it doesn#39;t happen in this App.];[You can verify tags are there by using Menu = Info which will show the actual tags. PowerAMP uses exactly artist and album tags (or title and artist tag for singles). It can also use various in-folder images for folders mode.];
pick random song from playlist based on probability	Each song in play list has a probability to be chosen next. You set this probability by some interface buttons. Just for example, higher for your favorite song, lower for others.Algorithm is rather easy to implement. Here is the link to C# analog: http:www.vcskicks....dom-element.php		03 December 2010 - 08:49 PM	barser	[Yeah or even just a few variants of shuffle, I find the shuffle algorithm plays the same songs sometimes? Maybe like a smart shuffle, which plays songs that have been played to completion (without skipping) or one that assigns higher probability to songs of the same genre..];[Or another variant could be playing songs from the folder that *haven#39;t* been played recently, so that there is a fair distribution.. Or a variant of shuffle which shuffles a folder without repetition until all songs are played..];[PowerAMP shuffles the whole selected list, i.e. it wont repeat any songs until the full list is played (unless you have duplications in the list itself).

lockscreen wipe please	Hi, this is the most wonderful player ever! Best Player on any smartphone, any OS and I had them all....IOS...Android....WM7...... Anyway.... I have a mytouch 4g, my lockscreen is swipe down. The P-AMP is tap only. Is there anyway to integrate this, like the stock android player? I catch myself trying to swipe, because that#39;s what I normally do, but then I need to tap. This goes also vice versa, because then I tap, when I have to swipe. Thanks		05 December 2010 - 07:16 PM	dogdaysunrise	[Thanks for the request. There is no way to integrate anything into other apps, including stock lock screen app. That would be huge security hole in android. You may want to try full-featured lock screen replacements, like Widget Locker where you can heavily customize the appearance and feel of the lock screen, and put the PowerAMP widget on it. PowerAMP will never be even close to that, as it#39;s a music player I will probably do the swipedrag option for unlocking, but it will be different from stock lock screens (there are many of them, actually, all have different unlocking approach).];[Appearance doesn#39;t matter, just a swipe unlock would be wonderful. Also maybe an on screen button to go to the folderslibrary without hitting the menu button on the phone and then selecting the folders? Like a quick folder shortcut on screen? And finally, my filestracks are not in order. What am I doing wrong? I use itunes, sync with tune sync. In the library they are in the right order as they are on the albumCD, but under folders they are all mixed up, or do I have to go always through library?

superimpose playback info over album art option	Something I#39;ve noticed while driving is that I can#39;t see the playback info very easily - at least not without spending far too much time studying the phone screen in detail, which would not be good! It#39;d be nice to have an option to superimpose simple large-font text of current playback position and total track length (plus maybe the track title?) over the Album Art graphic area. Andre		06 December 2010 - 09:50 AM	andrewilley	[Thanks for the request. This will come with the addition of 3rd partydownloadable skins in PowerAMP v2.0, so it will be possible to download special car skins pack.];
wma lossless file support	Please provide support for WMA lossless (Windows Media Audio 9 Lossless) music file type. Poweramp is a premium player and many Android users (including me) have large collections of music ripped to WMA lossless files. This would be a valuable offering and unique product differentiator. Thanks!		06 December 2010 - 05:44 AM	jtbrown3	[I#39;ll be looking into this. Unfortunately, wma is pretty closed format, and for example, DRM wma won#39;t be ever played in PowerAMP due to the legal issues. At the meantime, non drm lossless wma actually can be converted into any open lossless formats (e.g. flac), and the quality won#39;t be lost.];
albumfolder length	Hey... I#39;m loving the player, and especially looking forward to the implementation of gapless playback. A feature that would be nice, however, would be being able to see the total length of an albumfolder when selecting music. I don#39;t like to start albums unless I know I#39;ll have time to finish them, and sometimes I can#39;t remember how long all of my albums are. Thanks!		05 December 2010 - 04:16 AM	twinextralong	[That would sure be nice.];[Currently, PowerAMP doesn#39;t prescan all songs in a folder when it plays something from it. Thus, it#39;s not known what is the total length of album in the folder. For PowerAMP v2.0 background tag scanner will be used. While it will be 10-100 times faster than system scanner, it will still take up to 50-100ms per file (depends on sd card speed and cpu load and on system media scan activity, which tends to take 100 cpu and 100 sd card bandwidth while it#39;s active). Thus, such type of total times can be delayed and can#39;t be immediately available, but I#39;ll be looking into adding that. Anyway, when there is alternative between, delay song availability and add more cosmetic features OR make it faster and make the song available immediately, I tend to choose the later.];
pause music when playing youtube videos	Hi, I#39;m using the app from a Samsung Vibrant. So far, it is much better than the stock player, but it would be great if I were to open a Youtube video either from the dedicated link or through a link from the web browser, the music from Poweramp would stop playing. Also, I#39;m not sure if it is just me playing around with the app too much but my battery life seems to be slightly worse since using the app. It might just be me messing around with the EQ too much sine I just recently installed it and started tinkering with it.		04 December 2010 - 04:08 AM	stanleyshmanley	
request: large font interface	I like the scientific geek UI but I think a larger font or icon-based control panel would improve the user experience, especially after it#39;s all set up the way you want. this great app has returned a lot of fun to my music collection. the EQ really is great thanks		03 December 2010 - 05:36 PM	billythec11	
4 feature requests	Love the player. I feel like there are 4 ways it can be improved. 1: Gapless Playback 2: Retain Aspect Ratio of Album Art 3: Higher Resolution Thumbs For Album Art From Folder.jpg (not embedded) 4: Transparent Playback Controls		02 December 2010 - 12:28 AM	SikeMo	[Thanks for the request 1- planned (see TODO for the details) 2 - while I can add this option, viewable album art area will be clipped anyway, i.e. you can get album art clipped on the top and bottom if its height width etc. 3 - what thumbs do you mean? Thumbs are only used in Lists and they have exactly the dimension of the frame for them (96x96 on HDPI devices). 4 - that will be possible with the customdownloadable skins planned for v2.0];[Thanks for the reply... With regards to the album thumbs, it seems as though when I add music that does not have embedded art but has it stored as Folder.jpg, the resolution of the art on the playback screen is much lower. As far as the aspect ratio goes, why not put the whole image on the screen without clipping it and leave a black area on either the sides or the top depending on which dimension is larger?];
ringtone options	It is possible to add the ringtone to particular contact person in addition to the default ringtone. Thanks		29 November 2010 - 04:09 PM	x37v	[Thanks for the request. While it#39;s possible, I#39;m not sure I can give any priority for this feature. Actually, ringtone button will be probably moved deeper into menus as I need space for new frequently used actions, like add to q(ueue).];
play controls in notification area!	The Samsung Galaxy S player has play controls and cover art in the notification dropdown bar (where currently, Poweramp shows information about the file during play) and it#39;d be nice if Poweramp had this too.		26 November 2010 - 05:55 PM	herpderp	[Yeah, I thought the same. It should be great to have a quick access to the controls. Hi Max and thank you for your amazing work!];[Thanks for the request. Discussed here: viewtopic.php?f=3t=67p=1042hilit=notification#p1042];
current song on quot;defaultquot; playlist on long press headset	An intensive use of Poweramp made me though that should be very helpful the ability to save the current playing song in a pre-selected playlist without have to take the device, unlock it and choose the right menu button. I always use headset button and have a 16gb sd card, and so I have a LOT of music: create a playlist on-the-go, while driving, working, walking or running, without an "active action" (forgive the word joke but long pressing the button on the headset, will be very useful. Perhaps, it can became a customizable option (just like the "Use double pressing instead of long-press for skipping"). Maybe someone else can consider this useful too Hi Max and thank you again. Proud to had bought your great app. Valerio		02 December 2010 - 11:39 AM	VITRIOL	[Thanks for the request. There is no "current" playlist in PowerAMP, unless you actually playing some playlist, as PowerAMP doesn#39;t not need to create additional list just to play filessongs from library. I think, when configurable headset buttons controls will be added, it will be possible to assign button action to things like "bookmark" or "5 stars" current track to easily organize them later.];
customize folder view	I#39;d like to be able to customize the whole folder view.. I personally sort all my music in different folders, first a main folder for each artist, than subfolders for album and then the tracks inside each subfolder... with the current behaviour, I#39;ve been having to re-name all my subfolders to "Artist - Album" to get all albums by the same artist next to each other in the folder view... My suggestion is to make it possible to freely re-arrange the order which folders are shown in, and possibly re-name and create new folders only shown within the player, possibly similar to how the folder playlists work, but with more customization as I just explained.. or add this functionality to the folder playlists perhaps? Also.. the ability to select how the folder view is organized from different presets is also a suggestion, these could be: - Show all folders in (e.g) sdcardmusic (This would display all folders in selected folder on the SD-card, with sub-folders in them.. useful if your like me and sort all your music in separate folders for each artist and sub-folders for each album.. navigating would be like this: In folder view, you#39;ll see a list of main folders in the said music folder on the SD-card, rather than only folders containing music files, when you than select a artist ) - Show all folders containing music files (current behaviour pretty much) Can#39;t think of any more at the moment... but I#39;ve gotten another suggestion too... In the folder view: when you touch the thing on top saying "Showing X folderSelect all items" right now, you can add all to playlist or delete all.. but a 3rd option could be "Display all" which will bring up one big list of all your music in the Poweramp library (in a alphabetical order of course).. this is usefull if you want to display all your music in one list but have disabled the system scanner from scanning your music folders in the advanced folder options... also, when you press menu in the folder view, there is a empty space next to the "Shuffle all" option, why not add a "play all" option which would have the same effect, except for that it will not enable the shuffeling so that all songs plays in order...		01 December 2010 - 05:54 PM	Timmy Fox	[Thanks for the request. For the folders, optional (via settings) Hierarchy view will be added. I#39;m also thinking about adding the whole folders (as one itementity) to the folder playlists, instead of songs from it.

Chinese (tradsimpl)JapaneseGermanFrenchSpanish will be supported (and Russian already is, btw, but I don#39;t need 3rd party for that one:). Thanks!];[Awesome:) I want Swedish language, i can help with translations:)];
album sorting	Not sure if this was requested already but it would be nice to have a way to sort every album by a certain artist by track number. The way that it is now is it will list all track #1 at the top then #2 etc rather than showing track 1-12 for one album then 1-12 of the next and so on.		30 November 2010 - 10:26 PM	haticK	[Thanks for the request. What exactly albums do you mean? The sorting effect you described (by track #, multiple same tack numbers) is applied to All Artists Songs list, not to any albums, as albums generally don#39;t have same track # for many songs. I will think about grouping the songs by album in this list, the problem is that like 90 of users don#39;t have tags set properly and then this list will be pretty randomly sorted for them. I#39;ve just finished the "proper" Artist Albums (only the given artist songs are visibleplayable in Artist = Albums), so may be this will be bettersimpler to use (assuming there is auto advance to next album, as it is now for folders).];
album art swiping suggestion	I know you can disable the album art swiping to change track, but I#39;d like the ability to disable it for the lock screen widget (and possibly widgets in general) only, while keeping it enabled in the player... It#39;s getting slightly annoying at times when I#39;m trying to unlock the phone and accidentally change the song by being used to doing a gesture to unlock rather than tapping the unlock button. Another suggestion would be to make the album art follow the finger when you swipe, for some eyecandy.. also, perhaps also not switch track until you let go off the screen, like, the way it is at the moment, you can touch the album art, move your finger left or right, still keeping your finger on the screen, and it will still change to the previousnext track..		29 November 2010 - 12:04 AM	Timmy Fox	[Thanks for the requests. Yes, currently swiping setting affects both lock screen and main screen album art (). I#39;ll be thinking about adding separate option for lock screen swiping. Your second suggestion sounds great, I#39;ll be looking into implementing this (probably only for high-end phones).];[Oh yeah, forgot about that...I guess that#39;d make sense since not all lower-end phones support too intence 3D animations...];
camera button droid2	This is a great app. I bought full version after a few minutes of using free version.

This would be great for when my droid is connected to the AUX in my car.		28 November 2010 - 11:17 PM	glr1138	[Thanks for the request. This may be possible with the addition of configurable hardware button actions, though, camera button won#39;t probably work when screen is off or when PowerAMP is in the background.];
rewind button behavior	in other players, when you press the | button (rewind) and you are at the end of a song, you go to the start of the song. In Poweramp you go to the previous song. Please change it to the following behaviorIf you press rewind at the first one or two seconds of a song, go to previous songIf you press rewind later, go to the start of the current songWhat do you think? Maybe there already is an option to do this. Thanks[*]		21 November 2010 - 02:44 PM	artist	[I second this. This is the feature I most miss from other music players K];[I 3rd this.

Yes this is planned and will be in one of the next updates.];
remove and edit incorrect album art?	Some album art that you get through google search will be wrong unfortunately, so my suggestion is to somewhere present the user with an option to: - Try again with another image (picks next art in list of search results) - Remove the incorrect album art and revert to the standard no art image.		01 December 2010 - 01:58 AM	herpderp	[Thanks for the request.

back button should go to beginning of track	when a track is playing, the #39;back#39; button should go to the begging of the current track.

Yes I think I will do this as option as there already were few requests like that.

Also it#39;s possibleto reset to 0:00 by pressing elapsed time (time to the left of seek bar).];[thanks :-) For me, most of my listening is done 50 feet away from my Droid on my bluetooth headset so I don#39;t have the actual program in front of me, just my headset controls.

stop button (on long press of play button)	I requested this feature to Max in an email and he agreed already that it is planned and that he would add to TODO (as he did). But I will share with the forum the original request.PS. It wouldn#39;t be #39;2 secs#39; long press but roughly quicker than that. The Android OS can determine the long press timing itself.PS. The current existing #39;Stop#39; method in Poweramp is to press on the #39;time elapsed#39; text, however this only stops the track very briefly and then plays it again. With this Stop button added on long press it would keep the track stopped until the user chooses to play it again. Like any normal hardware or software player easy peeeezy		29 November 2010 - 09:12 AM	haddy	
sleep timer	Another handy feature you could implement for Poweramp (Would be handy for me at least, can#39;t really speak for everyone...) would be a sleep timer. So it would simply stop the music, and exit Poweramp after a set amount of time. That#39;s really all that is needed, although you could further it by adding a countdown somewhere or at least some way of checking how long is left before it will turn off automatically. Love the app, keep up the good work Stibbs.		04 November 2010 - 05:34 AM	Stibbs	[Thanks for the request.];[Seconded by me. I know it#39;s already on your ever-growing to-do list, but that little feature would be great for listening to stuff at night, so the player always turns itself off automatically after a set period (configurable) of no user interaction. I#39;d suggest options of 15, 30, 45, 60 or 90 minutes (or feature turned off for those who don#39;t want it to happen in regular use, of course). I#39;d much prefer that sort of background #39;always there#39; feature rather than a more basic "Sleep after 60 mins" button like you get on some TVs.

Andre];[This would be an awesome feature to add. I used to use a sleep timer on a music player app back in my dumbphone days of Sony Ericsson k800i (java me). Also the sleep timer function, when implemented, should have the ability to use cross-fading (also will soon come to Poweramp) which would be able to slowly fade the songtrack as it nears to it#39;s playing end..... A Perfect accommodation for the heavy sleeper like myself. thank you Max];
option to replace quot;libraryquot; with quot;playlistquot; button	Hi, it would be nice if users who do not use the library had an option to replace the "library" button with a "playlist" button. Right now it#39;s one nasty extra tap for such users each time they navigate to their folder playlists. Also it would be great if the "library", "playlist" and "folders" buttons would bring you back to the previously selected levelplaylistfolder. You could make it so that a short tap brings you to the previously visited levelplaylistfolder, wheres a long tap brings back the root level. You could make an option that allows to choose the default behaviour for short and long taps.		28 November 2010 - 08:58 PM	ohnoanotheraccount	[Thanks for the request. I got your point regarding the elimination of extra presses when library is not used and for the saving the last position in lists. I will think a little more about this and most probably I#39;ll add this into one of the minor updates as option.];[Cool, thanks for considering it!];
default music player	Ability to set as default music player. I have other applications that use the music player and would like to use this instead. Also ability to use actual Last.fm scrobbler instead of the alternatives		27 November 2010 - 04:08 PM	Curtdragon	[Thanks for the request. PowerAMP registers itself as an app which is able to play the music files (so if you start some music file from file manager, it will propose to start PowerAMP as well). PowerAMP also registers itself as headset handler. There are no notion of default player in Android - each case should be handled separately. You can use the standard Last.fm app - Last.fm app supports Simple Last.fm protocol - so just enable it in PowerAMP scrobbling settings. I will add explicit option for that to options a bit later as well.];[Thanks both worked for me! Great player!];
track options from the main player screen, as well as list?	This one#39;s a simple little request. It would be nice to be able to long-press on the "now-playing" area of the main player screen (i.e. the Track Ttle, Artist, Album Title, etc wording) to get the same useful pop-up that you get via a long-press in the files-list screen (e.g. stuff like Add to PL, Ringtone, Info, Delete, etc). I tend to delete podcasts after listening, so it#39;d be really handy to have that option from the main player screen when the show starts wrapping up. At the moment, I have to press once to get to the files list and then again to get the pop-up option. Andre		22 November 2010 - 11:30 AM	andrewilley	[Thanks for the request.

midmidi playback	Back when i was a dial-up user midi#39;s were the only kinds of song i could stream or download without waiting all day so i have collected quite a few of them.

album art thumb in notification area	I#39;ve noticed that some apps (i.e. Photoshop Mobile) can use specific thumb image instead app icon in the notification area when uploading photos.

output audio to headphone jack while connected to bluetooth	Hey.. First off I just want to say great job on power amp..I#39;m really loving it so far.. at first I wasn#39;t sure if I should buy Poweramp because I really loved the music player on my galaxy s.. However, I realized it has issues in my opinion.. First, sound quality.. It#39;s pretty bad, volume kinda goes up and down on different frequencies, second, theres no"shuffle all" option from the library, third it has no 4x4 widget.. (I#39;m sure there#39;s more but these are the ones that immediately come to mind.. That said, Poweramp addresses all of those downfalls from the stock player.. (btw, the 4x4 home and lock widgets were the kicker that made me decide to purchase Poweramp), anyhoo, on with the feature request My problem is that there is currently no way other than going into the stock player to change the audio output.. Let me explain. When I#39;m in my car, I plug my phone in an auxiliary jack to make use of the video out feature, but I still need bluetooth to be paired for phone calls, but as soon as I connect via bluetooth, Poweramp automatically outputs the audio to bluetooth, so which means no sound at all in my case.. The only way I#39;ve been able to get around this is by launching the default player, start playing a song so I can get into "now playing", press the menu button and chose the "via phone" option, stop the music, exit the default player, launch Poweramp and play music.. So, would it be possible to have that same option in Poweramp or some kind of preference to set a default output? This would be really awesome and would allow me to put my galaxy s music player to rest once and for all, and Poweramp would reign as the new king of music on my phone! Keep up the great work and I hope you consider my request.. sly		25 November 2010 - 06:32 AM	slyguy77	[Thanks for the request. I will be looking into this.];
album art grid view for folders?	Hello all.Firstly, thank you for such a great music player. I bought it as soon as it became avaliable for purchase, and I love it. It#39;s especially easy to use while driving due to the gestures on album art.I was wondering, the folder list looks a little simple at the moment. Would it be possible to implement a grid style album view for it, like in iTunes and XBMC (screens attached). This would not only have an obvious visual improvement, but it would also be much easier to quickly change an album whilst driving, or doing other things.Here#39;s a couple of example screenshots. I#39;d really appreciate any feedback or thoughts on this.		10 November 2010 - 12:16 PM	WooBarb	[Bump.];[from here: viewtopic.php?f=1t=172Thanks!];[Probably the best mobile implementation of album art grid is Cubed ^3 - lots of inspiration there.];[I look forward to it, thank you!];
screen on for a few secs on song change	Just thought of another idea. When I#39;m studying, and the phone is on the table, or when I#39;m in the car and the phone is in its cradle - I listen to music but I don#39;t keep the screen on all the time (battery drain). It would be cool if there was an option that if the screen is off, then when a song changes the player would turn the screen on for a few seconds, so you could see the song name and and art and then turn it back off automatically. What do you think?		23 November 2010 - 09:48 PM	vyath	[Thanks for the report. This was fixed in build-276 available here viewtopic.php?f=1t=281 As this affected limited number of users I don#39;t put this on the market, but the fix will be included in the update on market in a week or so.];[umm... it#39;s not a report.. it#39;s a feature request. so how could it have been "fixed"?];[Ah sorry, I thought you#39;re about the screen flashing problem (when PowerAMP changed tracks) which affected some users Actually, for auto-cradle I think permanent screen on feature is more appropriate (it can be already configured this way for docks afaik), and PowerAMP will include "keep screen on" function as well.];[yeah - always on is good if your cradle has a usb connection. mine doesn#39;t though, so i usually keep my screen off and just hit the power button and look at the playing song on the lock screen widget every time a song changes, then lock the screen again with the power button so it would be nice if the screen turned on for a sec or two so i could see what song is next instead of doing it manually dunno, but maybe it#39;s just me... perhaps other people will think it#39;s a weird feature request];[I agree. Sometimes I use my cradle, sometimes with power, sometimes without, so for those times that I don#39;t use it with power it would be good to save energy by just turning the screen on for 15secs when the track changes. I also think that it would be less distracting when driving (especially at night) to only have the screen on for a few seconds rather than constantly. I am very new to Poweramp (just starting using it today), so far I very much like what I see. I have been using Mixzing and in most areas Poweramp is better, but this is one feature that Mixzing has that Poweramp is currently lacking and may prevent me from actually purchasing Poweramp.

my opinion	Hi! This player is REALLY amazing! I couldn#39;t find any decent player until the day I discovered Winamp player. That was great (i like the enqueue fonction) but the design was not very good. Then I#39;ve found Poweramp, what attracted me most are the colors, the smoothness and the equalizer of course! There is just one thing that makes me hesitate with the sense player: Although the lists of songs are very well designed, i think the buttons and the player could be way more polish if I compare to the sense player or the iphone#39;s one... Even the programm icon looks pixellised on my Legend (or at least not very clean). That being said, i really respect your work! That was just a suggestion I#39;ll of course buy it when my trial version ends !		22 November 2010 - 09:33 PM	logoo	
features for large collections	I am going to get a 32 GB memory card and dump my entire record collection to my phone (my stereo runs from my hard drive). That does need some special features: * Hierarchical folder display which I know is on the TODO list. * The ability to play all of the files in a folder, straight through in sorted order, and stop. In PC players, this is usually handled by creating a temporary play-list by a "Select All" button. Being able to tap on a folder or album to play it would be nice. This is really important and many PC media players do not handle it very well. * At least one saved play-list with the ability to play it straight through or a random shuffle, independent of the folder layout. I can#39;t tell if this feature already exists or not. I have had problems figuring out how the play-list feature works.

itunes playlists synching?

display embeeded album art in flac files	Displaying embedded cover art embedded in FLAC files would be a very nice addition, and it doesn#39;t appear to be very difficult to implement. FLAC files use OGG tags, which have supported standardized embedded album art for a while now. I have attached a small snippet of a track in FLAC format complete with tags and embedded album art for testing. Implementing this feature would be a very big help to me, as I make many folder based compilations which require album art to be embedded within the file itself.

searching	Okay, I have two suggestions to improve the ability to search for songs... 1. Lets say your in the main folder menu and wants to find a specific song, so you hit the search button and type in the title of the song, but do you find what you want? Probably not since it only searches for folders with that name, why not also search through the folders for songs with the matching title too? Then when you find your song and touch it to play, it plays the song from within the direct folder. 2. Why not also add support for adding Poweramp to the list of searchable items? Then of course you can filter out what to search in, e.g only search for folders, only search media library, only search for folders and songs within etc..		20 November 2010 - 01:18 AM	Timmy Fox	[Thanks for the request. 1. is planned (called - full-library search here viewtopic.php?f=1t=172) 2. not sure what do you mean by list searchable items? Do you mean android global search? While it#39;s possible, adding PowerAMP search results will do the massive duplication as these songs also exist in system media Library which is always searched by global search. The only possibility for correct search here is if user disables system media scan for PowerAMP handled folders (in v2.0 this will not clear the Library lists in PA). But this requires some techy skills from the phone owner (heshe need to understand difference between libraries, need to understand why the songs won#39;t be in other players anymore and how to revert this behavior).];[2. Yeh, the global search.. Well, I thought maybe by default only list results from the folders category and filter out everything from the system media library, then you can maybe change the filtering to not filter at all or filter the results from the folders category... If that is possible to do.];
cover art	I would like to see the cover art for each song: 1)when browsing the All songs list. (for reference the HTC player does this.) 2)when browsing the playlist. 3)when browsing inside the folder. Basically the same way as when you browse the albums, you see little cover art on the left for each album. i would like to see that option for each song. Most mp3 now days have cover art embeded in them. BTW this is the most awesome player.		19 November 2010 - 01:53 AM	terpsarlington	[Thanks for the request.];

galaxy s music app features	Thanks for the request. Samsung Galaxy S is one of my test phones, so I do know what features its music app has. 1. PowerAMP already have the Alpha indexer (Standard android one - works when you have alpha-num sort enabled, not for track # based sorts). It#39;s possible to add the optional always-visible a-z line, though this will work only for english, and i#39;m supporting more than one language for now. 2. while this can produce some wow-effect, I#39;m doubtful about actual usabilty of this. I#39;m more focused on audio quality and the most frequently player functions for now. For example, auto equalizer + custom presets VS that sort of cover flow (which requires hi end devices and won#39;t work well on low end) - equalizer wins. On the visual effect department, the frequency analyzer and wave visualizations are planned. 3. It#39;s not possible to integrate into the system lock screens like that for 3rd party app. Even the standalone custom lock screen will always have issues on some phones due to the non-standardnot-supported APIs - each phone implements it differently and there are at least 200 android models on the market, and yes, all of them has differences in their lock screen implementation.		19 November 2010 - 03:43 PM	admin	[I#39;m not saying no to anything that can be implemented and that doesn#39;t make PowerAMP a bloatware. There are some resourcetime constraints though, so this can see the light a bit later - in v3.0 for example (I will definitely need more features for it )];[v2 will take two months. I will start it when all minor updates are complete (actually I could name it v2.0 for these features, but for now it#39;s just increase in build number).];
mp3+g karaoke lyric support	First, let me add to the well-deserved chorus of praise for your work on Poweramp. You are consistently working to make an excellent app even better. Thank you. And now to beg for features! Poweramp already supports an extensive list of file formats, and also has the ability to display song lyrics for the playing track. Would it be exceedingly difficult to add support for playing files in the MP3+G and related formats? MP3+G is currently (I believe) the most common format in use by commercial karaoke systems, but there are a small handful of others. I may be getting the details mixed up, but I think MP3+G is essentially a standard MP3 file with additional information about lyrics and the timings to synchronize them with the audio track. This lyrictiming information is either included directly in the MP3+G file, or stored separately in a file with an identical filename (but with a different extension). The lyric display overlay that Poweramp uses now would likely be ill-suited for displaying lyrics synchronized to the audio, as traditionally the karaoke system displays only a few lines at a time. Is including a full-screen, time-synchronized lyric display option possible? Would something like this be better as a separate extension to Poweramp? Thanks once again for the impressive work you#39;ve done so far.		19 November 2010 - 07:02 AM	bifkit	[Thanks for the feedbackrequest. There are some planned lyric improvements for the next versions (you can check it in TODO announcement here on the forum). For example, lyrics will be optionally shown over the shaded album art. As for mp3+g, this can go to the next releases after the 2.0 (2.0 is settled more or less at this moment).];
stream last.fm stations	It would be a nice addition if Poweramp could stream last.fm stations. This would allow us to take advantage of Poweramp#39;s EQ while listening to streaming audio. It would give it a major leg up on the DoubleTwist and Winamp players.		14 November 2010 - 11:53 PM	Smabbage	[Thank you for the request.

I, as all others really like your player, but my question is kind of confusing as most all other apps that I#39;ve had that had trial versions would either require for you to remove the trial version after purchasing the #39;Pro#39; version andor would automatically be removed after reboot. Well, obviously with that not being the case here, should or could we remove the trial version ? B.T.W. I bought it through the Market if that is a factor, which I can#39;t imagine it being. *Thanks! Droid Really Does		19 November 2010 - 07:18 AM	immobile	[Thanks for the question. You shouldn#39;t remove the Trial version. Full Version Unlock is sort of key to unlock the full version. It is only 60kb and it doesn#39;t start new process or take any memory - it integrates as a plugin into PowerAMP. This is pretty standard way on android (see e.g. Mizxing full version, etc.).];
delete protection	First, best audio player out there. I would love a delete protection option in the settings. Perhaps a check box that when checked, disables the delete buttons. With the buttons so prominent, my clumsy fingers have hit delete a few times. One time, due to my phone hanging a little, I actually deleted the tune. Luckily I had recent backed them up. Perhaps even an exra confirmation level. I love it though and just bought the full version and deleted Mixzing. a		17 November 2010 - 11:31 PM	Bigralphn	[Thank you for the request. It#39;s actually also shows confirmation dialog on delete, but there is no problem of adding the option to disable it (except that there can be too many options];[Is it possible to delete a song from the playlist list? It seems just to remove from the playlist. I actually want to delete off sd card. thanks];[it deletes it just from playlist, not from the sd card - like in other players. To be able to delete also from sd card, either additional button is needed or extra dialog, both ways seems like not too usable atm.];[I like to delete songs that I have just played to make room for more on the sd card. I usually create a playlist of random songs from different folders. Any ideas on how to do this. What I have done is open the playlist with playerpro or mixzing and do it from there.];[Actually, the feature I wanted is not necessary if it does not delete the file off of the sd card. That was my fear. I have done that twice with other players unintentionally. Accideny hit delete and the phones freezes. Hit no and whe it catches up, it has deleted it. If I want to completely delete it, I would rather use a file manager.];
feature request for 2.0: song rating widget	With Song Rating planned for 2.0 I would like to ask MaxMP to add a simple 5 stars widget in sizes 2x1 and 4x1 (with song name and album art) that is used to rate the currently played song. I use to rate my newly listened songs on iPod Touch thanks to how easy it is to use rating from iPod app. On Android it is not that easy but should be even easier thanks to such widget.		18 November 2010 - 03:33 PM	raynerape	[Thanks for the request. I#39;ll be looking into this.];
podcast playlist synchronization	I synchronize itunes playlist with my nexus one using sailing media sync, but the podcast playlist don#39;t do. With others player (stock player, winamp, music mod by elliot stocker), this playlist appears. there will be good if you find the way to make power amp shows. Thanks for your work.		11 November 2010 - 08:34 PM	GIKE	[and a 4x4 widget!];[4x4 widget is in the build-269 available on market.];[You#39;re right, thanks!];
android livepaper support	Support for the Spectrum and Waveform live wallpapers that come with android devices by default.		18 November 2010 - 05:39 PM	wiimonkey9	
few suggestions...	Yeah, as title states, I#39;ve got a few suggestions that#39;d make my life easier: 1. Option to always return to player from the equalizer settings when you press the back button. 2. Option to when you listen to a song and touch the previous song button, I#39;d prefer to have it play the current song from the start instead of going back to the previous song if your more than 5-10 seconds into the current song. This is how other players usually behave so I atleast would like that option. 3. Ability to quene songs or atleast add it as either next or last song in the current playlist your playing. 4. Ability to customize the track order in playlists, like if I had a playlist with 5 songs in it, and want song #3 in the list to be the first song to play instead and #4 to be the last to play... 5. Save custom presets for the equalizer, and maybe edithidedelete the default presets? Yeah, I guess thats all, must say that I am a happy owner of the full version ^^		14 November 2010 - 05:23 PM	Timmy Fox	[Thanks for the requests and feedback. 1. Back button navigates to the previous activity in the Android. For FoldersLib this is overridden in PowerAMP to return to the previous folderalbumartistetc., but still there is "Return to previous" behavior for this button. Changing it to always return to player will create more questions. Also, the initial (startup ) activity can be changed in PowerAMP settings to Library or now playing list, so it#39;s not always the player ui that is "main". 2. Yes, I#39;ve already have this request and it will be implemented as option. 3-4-5. planned for v2.0 or minor updates];[1. Yeh, but wouldn#39;t it be possible to implent it as a option to either do it like I suggested or the way it is right now? 2-3-4-5. Okay than.];
liveview	I love Poweramp! I really wish it was compatible with Sony Ericsson#39;s LiveView though. That would be amazing :0)		17 November 2010 - 11:26 PM	demute	[Thanks for the feedback.];
track numbers on player screen	I wanted to request the addition of track numbers on the main player screen somewhere near the artist, album, song info. For example if an album had 15 tracks and you were playing track 11 it would read: 1115. This would let you know how far you were in an album or playlist without having to check the library.		18 November 2010 - 05:03 AM	pDASH	[Thanks for the request.];
poll poll: social networking in your music app?!	I have now seen two posts asking for social networking and am seriously concerned this amazing app is going to turn into some social networking crap. I do not see any reason someone has a need to spam the internet with what music they are playing on their cell phone. By adding social networking to this music app it runs the risk of using excessive battery life due to network use and the added permissions needed lead to security risks. There are many other feature suggestions here that have far more importance then stupid social networking. IMO the dev should be focusing time on those features and not one that only little brat children will use. My phone has enough social networking bloatware installed on it from Motorola, no need to add more. If you choose yes, I would love to hear what kind of logic you are using and reasoning for wanting social network integration. Do you actually think people care what song you are listening to? Are you that arrogant you need to push that info on the world? Do you really need to look "cool" to your friends online by showing you are playing a certain song? What actual use does broadcasting to the world what you are playing on your phone have?		08 November 2010 - 11:43 PM	Thalinor	[Amazingly, I#39;ve decided to post even though you, sir (I assume), seem to have the problem with arrogance and believing that yours is the only opinion that matters and everybody shares. I know that many, many people like to share what they#39;re listening to at a given moment, or like sharing lyrics of a song that they#39;re listening to on Facebook and Twitter. In fact, I dlvr.it to post tracks I "love" from last.fm to Twitter, and they get picked up by Facebook. There aren#39;t that many I mark as loved, so they don#39;t "flood" the Internet with this kind of content. Mostly, people will comment, "like" the post, and ask questions about the track that#39;s posted. There#39;s a reason why services like last.fm have RSS feeds for this content: people use it.I agree with the developer that this functionality exists and doesn#39;t "need" to be duplicated, but then again technically making a music player is a duplication of efforts by many others (including the Google developers of the stock player). So, what#39;s the point of making another player at all? It offers features and a design that people like (even disregarding "The Great Shuffle Debate"), and the developer is asking for more requests and ideas. This could be something that more people like, so why not let it go rather than whine and complain about SOMEONE ELSE#39;S idea? Even if implemented, it would likely be purely optional anyway and not a big deal.To those that want this feature now, all you have to do is create a www.last.fm account, install the last.fm player on your phone, PC, Mac, Linux system, etc., and pump the RSS feed of tracks you play to whatever you like. No need to wait.];[Nuff said. Angry dude didn#39;t even reply, haha.];
spectrum analyzer	Would love to see some type of spectrum analyzer incorporated		10 November 2010 - 07:51 AM	sctwinslow	[Dito, that would be very nice!!! Like in Winamp for PC for example!];[Thanks for the request, it#39;s planned = viewtopic.php?f=1t=172];
love poweramp, two suggestions...	Hey, just discovered Poweramp and I am so impressed by it! It rocks and is so far the best player I have seen and tried out, I love it! Great work!!! And keep it going! I noticed one thing that I would like being implemented in a future upgrade...24h-option on the lockscreen, for the time, that would work better for us here in Sweden! And also, an option to choose to queue tracks to a playlist that you are already playing, like in the Winamp-app just released for Android. It#39;s often that I listen to an album, and want to add new tracks to the playlist or album. The queue-function is great! Just some ideas! Keep it going!!!		11 November 2010 - 04:24 PM	Freeman	[Thanks! 24h12h mode should be taken from the system properties, basically it should show the same time format as other clocks. As for other feature(s) you can check my TODO list here: viewtopic.php?f=1t=172];[Funny, I was just going to start a post with that same title... Poweramp is great, one of the few purchases I have made. Here are my two centssuggestions: -Please make lockscreen more like a #39;real#39; lockscreen, at least so it responds to trackball wake and unlock when enabled under cyanogenmod.. -Ability to sort all songs. I don#39;t use folders, only have the one, but I add a few songs every week to it, and while I usually shuffle the whole folder all the time, I would really like to be able to viewplay the folder by #39;date added#39;.. Thanks and keep up the good work!];[You can sort folders and files in it by date added, but not in the Library at this moment.];[Yeah sorry I only saw this option after and reworked my library into a few folders only (instead of a folder per artist like itunes or doubletwist has it) and this is fine for me, thanks! For the lockscreen I guess you have your hands full with people asking you left and right for different things but on my nexus 1 I have CM and I use the trackball to wake and unlock (unlock by double clicking). If the Poweramp lockscreen was unlocked by this (it gets woken, so I see the lockscreen, but a second trackball click doesn#39;t unlock) it would really suit all my needs, thanks!];[For the sake of completeness I would just like to clarify the original feature request was an automatic "recently added" PL, like on the stock player, but which would organize the songs added in the past few weeks by order added (across all folders)..];[Hey and thanks for replying! :-)I don#39;t know why my lockscreen shows the english ampm-time, when I don#39;t use it on my phone in the settings and so on. The original lockscreen shows the time as we use it here in Sweden, 24-hours. Is there anything else that I have to change to make it work in Poweramp lockscreen as well?];[I#39;ve just checked - switching tofrom 24h in android settings immediately takes effect on PowerAMP#39;s lock screen time format. What is your phone modelandroid osrom? Thanks!];
a line-out mode?	Is it possible to implement a line-out mode, that would bypass all the preamps on the device and send the signal straight without any alterations? I#39;m planning on buying a headphone amp and that would be useful with it Cheers		15 November 2010 - 02:36 AM	peterabelard	[I don#39;t think it#39;s possible in general. This type of tweaks can be only available for device driverfirmware devs - i.e. it may be possible for some ROMS.];
save eq settings for song, genre, custom.	It would be nice to have: 1. EQ settings for each song saved and loaded automagically when the song starts 2. EQ settings for each song saved and loaded automagically when the genre starts. 3. Custom saved EQ settings. Keep up the great work.		17 November 2010 - 03:10 PM	H13	[Thanks. Something like that is already in the TODO list.];
manual order to re-scan folders	Hi there, it seems to me, that right now power amp re-scans folders only on event of being unplugged from the PC ( or maybe SD card mounted ). However it doesn#39;t re-scan on actual change in the folder. Example: I download podcast via wireless with podcatcher and save the mp3 file into folder that is supposed to be scanned by power-amp. The file doesn#39;t appear added until I mount the phone to PC and back. Could it be possible to add some command to menusettings which would allow to re-scan folders?		16 November 2010 - 07:21 PM	tealover	[Thanks for the request. Due to high possible number of folders, tracking all directories for changes constantly can be costly for the phone resources. PowerAMP re-scans folders on card mount event or when directly asked by user via setting menu.];
quot;add to now playing queuequot; needed. then its perfect	I absolutely love this music app. I had mixzing before but I like your designlayout and features more. I feel like this app has the best set of features that you need and it looks good, while keeping it basic and simple. That#39;s not easy to accomplish. That being said, in order for this to be the hands down best music app it needs the ability to add songalbumartist to the now playing queue. I imagine it would be an option when you hard click (press and hold) a songalbumartist along with "add to pl" "play all" "shuffle all" "delete all" which are already there. I love being able to easily make a playlist on the fly with out having to save and reopen a playlist. Right now this is the best all around music player available, but with this addition it will be best music player period. You#39;ve really nailed all of the basic features people look for in a music player. Keep up the great work and I look forward to the updates you#39;ll be releasing.		15 November 2010 - 07:47 PM	thool44	[Thanks for the feedback. There are two kind of peoples: those who like folder playing and those, who like tag (library) based playing with playlists. I#39;m trying to combine both worlds in one app, but there are some logical limitations For example, if you choose some folder to play, there is no queue - there is a plain list of files (from file system folder) to play. It#39;s possible to add virtual queue for few songs - so you can queue some other file for playing after the current song ends. But after queue ends there are two options - stop playing or resume playing from the last file which should be played before something was enqueued. As you can see, this can be pretty complicated to understand. So for folders, just play this file as next one will work better. Users expect generally sequentialshuffled folder files playing in this mode without parallel "current" play lists or queues. For Library, PowerAMP doesn#39;t use the notion of "current playlist" as well - i.e. when you click some song in All songs it starts playing from this position and continues to end VS playing just the one song which got to the "current playlst". What I#39;m going to add as queues to PowerAMP is sort of virtual dynamic playlist which is generated when user enqueues something (probably from both folders and library), plus the option to either stop when queue ends or resume from the next song it should be playing without the queue.];
more features	1. Shake to shuffle is possible, but there is drawback - sensor will consume some power, pretty major on some devices. 2. This feature sounds interesting, but I need to really see it on other devices (iphone) first.		02 November 2010 - 02:51 PM	admin	[here is the fine scroling speed he is talking about demonstrated on the iPhone];[#2 seems like really nice feature. I will try to add it with the addition of better seeking for long mp3 files. Thanks again!];[Yes, not in todo for v2.0. This is in my internal list of future features, but 2.0 features are mostly settled already. I want to release v2.0 in couple of months tops, and I need to support and add features to v1.0 as well in parallel, this is why the todo list is limited for given version. This stuff can patented as well (apple patents everything) - then no way to add it at all.];
save eq settings	This would come in very handy for different speaker setups.		10 November 2010 - 10:37 PM	Trey	[Yes please!];[Yes, and let us delete the default presets and replace them with our own. Everyone has different headphonesspeakersearsmusic, so predefined settings will always be changed by the users who play with the EQ.];[Yes to the custom equalizer settings. Good to see this is being worked on.];
player link back to now playing?	I#39;d like to start off that I absolutely love this player, and I can#39;t wait to purchase it.However, I would really like a way to get back to the now playing "Player" part of the app without having to use the physical buttons on my Droid X. Currently, I click on the menusettings physical button, then select player.In winamp, no matter where you were in the app, you can see what#39;s currently playing by dragging the bottom bar up.See:http:i1-news.softp... ... Beta-2.png "Now Playing Slide up to view more info."Would that be possible? An easy implementation (I assume) I thought of is below.Perhaps an additional button in between Folders and Library? Image below: Current functionality Possible addition?It#39;s something I frequently do, and having to use the physical buttons and an additional step, for whatever reason, rubs me the wrong way. Sorry for being lame.Perhaps even a setting in the menu to disableenable such a button, in case no one else uses it?		02 November 2010 - 06:27 PM	Mikesnav	[Thanks for the request. Yes, I think it#39;s pretty possible (probably via option, may be even by default). Though, Back button is mostly intended for this, but if you come to playlist from eq, it will return you back to eq, so Player button makes sense.];[Depending on how you entered the app, hitting back can also take you back to the android home screen desktop, as opposed to the previous screen in power-amp. I would love the addition - thanks for considering it.];[If possible, please describe such scenario. Thanks!];[One frustrating example is in car dock mode. I add the Poweramp link to the Car Dock Mode home screen, and when I touch the link, it takes me to the folderlibrary view. When I#39;m driving, I like seeing what#39;s playing, so I#39;m forced to click on the menu button, then the player link in the pop up screen. Clicking back takes me to the car dock screen. A "Player" link would fix this nicely, as pictured above.];[You#39;re amazing. Thank you for the addition. Purchased!];[Thank you!];
3rd party custom skins	I saw that 3rd party skin is supported. I checked the forums for the development files but couldn#39;t find anything.

please support dcf file format 	Dear max This player(power amp) is brillant !!! I#39;ve never seen before. But, can#39;t play DCF(DRM content format) file format.

I don#39;t think any DRM format can be supported by PowerAMP due to the legal issues.];[Oh, no... maybe you mis-understand my request. You don#39;t have to commit illegal action. I didn#39;t want you to hack DCF, I want to check DRM permission is right or wrong. I#39;ve used another smart phone(with Windows mobile 6.5), it has a custom player designed by normal user, the player can play back DCF. one more check please....^^];

change tracks by long-pressing volume button	I have no idea if this is possible within the constraints of the Android API, but I figure it#39;s worth asking.... One of the (few) things I miss from my Blackberry Storm is the ability to change tracks by long-pressing the volume buttons. I considered that function absolutely invaluable on a touchscreen device, especially since I keep my phone holstered (face-in) on my hip. My implementation of choice would be to hook the Volume-Up, Volume-Down, and Camera buttons when the screen is locked. Long-pressing Camera would toggle PlayPause. Holding down Volume UpDown would trigger NextPrevious after about 34 of a second. A short press of Volume Up or Down would change the volume by one notch on button-release. The lack of this feature is the sole reason I still sometimes pull out my Storm to listen to music, when I know I#39;ll be in a situation that would make touch-controls inconvenient.		01 November 2010 - 10:56 PM	XenIneX	[Thanks for the request. Currently, this is possible only on few devices with altered ROMs. Android just doesn#39;t send keypresses to 3rd party apps when screen is off.];[How about having this feature work while the screen is on? Long-Press volume UpDown to go to NextPrev track? Pressing the volume buttons on my phone (HTC Incredible) turns the screen on anyways....So, it would not be difficult to just press the volume button...than long press to change tracks.];[This is available if you flash CyanogenMod, which is a free custom ROM];[Does it work in Poweramp specifically? so if I use that ROM and long press the volume buttons...the tracks will change in Poweramp?];[Yep, it is one of the many super useful features of that ROM. (nevermind the speed and customizability, just get the 6.1 on the xda site, wipe and flash and you should be good).];
mono	You#39;re doing incredible work, and I hope you#39;re making a TON of money off of this project. How easy would it be to add an option for mono playback? It would be a nice accessibility touch for users who are deaf in one ear =) Thanks!		14 November 2010 - 05:46 PM	yellow5	
lockscreen, tag editor	Hey MaxGreat job with PA! The fact that I can finally start using all my HE-AACv2 encoded music again, thus freeing several gigs of my SD, is enough to make me buy this. All the other awesome features are just sugar coating. Now for the features I#39;ve had in mind:Lockscreen:1. It would be nice to have the controls stuffed away in a drawer, e.g. just show the cover with artistalbumtitle info and have the user slide this up to reveal the actual controls. This way accidental key presses due to screen turning on would be prevented (see e.g. Mort Player for inspiration). 2. I#39;d appreciate if you could make sure future versions of PA cooperate nicely with Widgetlocker. There#39;s some code given on the WL website on how to enabledisable or suspendresume WL while other lockscreen apps are running. I guess you could implement it so that WL gets suspended whenever the PA lockscreen is running, then resume WL once PA is pausedstopped? Would be great for it#39;d finally make it possible to have a decent player with lockscreen controls AND a customized lockscreen for general use.You can find the relevant code here: http:teslacoilsw.c...ckerdevelopersTag editing:It would be nice to have the option to quickly edit tags on a per-album level, meaning editing tags globally for all files in a folder an album instead of having to do it for each song. Would come in very handy whenever one realizes that e.g. a whole albums genre is wrong.Thanks for considering and keep it up!		09 November 2010 - 12:36 PM	Tomdroid	[Thanks for the feedback and the requests. 1. Sounds like a good option, I will consider adding this into one of the next minor releases. 2. I think PowerAMP lock screen should be disabled completely if you use WidgetLocker or any other lock screen replacement - you can just put 4x2 widget there and it will give the same functionality. 3. Yes, mass tag editing may be useful. My only concern is slow system library here. Each edited song should be checked against system library and should be updated there also - and system library is slow on this. With the custom own PowerAMP library it will be very fast, so I will probably add this into TODO for v2.0.];[The thing with WidgetLocker is that a) The widget on the lockscreen makes the problem of accidental clicks permanent, in fact worsens it. It#39;s bad enough if the phone starts doing unintended actions while one#39;s listening to music, but it#39;s even worse when it accidentally starts playing music just because the screen turned on and a button on the PA widget got pressed. The only way to counter this with WL is by deactivating widget interactions (which I have mine set to). But then, using the PA widget on the lockscreen would require another 2 steps - and this kind of defeats having the widget there in the first place, as simply unlocking and going to the full player takes the same amount of steps. Having the PA widget there defeats the purpose of having a clean, everyday lockscreen with essential information only. I mean, The user does really not need to see the PA widget all the time, even if one#39;s not listening to music. E.g. on my WL LS I#39;ve got the time date (TypoClock), missed SMS calls (SMS Unread Count), forecast (Snowstorm), battery level (BattStatt) and a drawer that get#39;s me straight to the camera and straight into PA. If I wanted to have the PA widget on there, I#39;d have to get rid of at least the forecast (for space) and also use one of the sliders to unlock interactions (for accessibility) while "wasting" the space with a 4x1 widget that I only use a small percentage of the time. It#39;s no matter of life and death obviously but seeing that the WL dev even offers the interfaces, why not just using them in your app? Think of it like this: It#39;d make PA the first and only media player to play nicely with WL (afaik).];[I got your point. I will try to work a bit with WL and check if it#39;s possible to integrate. If it is, this will be added in one of the next updates.];[Awesome, thanks!];[Hey Max Just wanted to let you know, seems Kevin has tweaked WidgetLocker to better work with (all?) other lockscreen replacing apps. I only knew he#39;d done something about better compatibility with GentleAlarm, however since the last update it seems to be working quite well with Poweramp: When PA is running and one unlocks the screen for the first time, there#39;s a tiny delay where one sees the WL, then it switches to the PA lockscreen. From there on any further turning on of the screen immediately brings up the PA ls. Quite perfect and unless that#39;s rather a bug than a feature, I#39;d say this issue got solved already.];[Cool, thanks for the update.];[I#39;ve asked Kevin, the WL dev about this and his answer is:"In 1.2.8 I added support for the PauseMediator: http:code.google.c...pausemediatorThis is an attempt to be a standard way to control third party lock screen. GentleAlarm uses this so that was my reason for adding it, but it sounds like Poweramp uses it too."];
support for free-form genres multiple values per tag	It seems Poweramp only uses the static genre list from ID3v1 and ignores the custom ID3v2 genre tags I#39;ve added to my songs. Since the static list is very limited it would be great if the values from the tags could also be used.On a related note, my desktop music player (http:code.google.compquodlibet) supports multiple values per tag field by separating them with dashes. I don#39;t know how standardized this is and haven#39;t seen it yet in other players, but maybe you could consider adding this feature? Currently it looks like only the first value will be used (probably because my player only stores the first value in the ID3v1 tag).Are ID3v2 tags actually used at all?		10 November 2010 - 03:27 PM	toupeira	[Thanks for the request. The genres list is System Library provided list, scanned with system media scanner. So I can#39;t tweak it much. This will change with the addition of custom PowerAMP Library in v2.0.];[[Merging my original thread with this one since the issues are related.]Just in case you hadn#39;t planned this for your own library function yet:Happy to finally be able to use m4a with correct audio decoding, I#39;ve reworked my whole library yesterday, cleaning out ALL tags, fixing album art, sorting albums in genre folders etc.The disappointment didn#39;t wait too long though:All m4a files have their genre tags mis- or rather uninterpreted by Android. Meaning, all my 100 correctly tagged files (over 1000 for the first test batch) show as genre "unknown". When long pressing on a single file and reading the tags in PA, it shows me the correct genre, as I had saved. As one can quickly see in the google code forums, this is yet another problem of Androids lousy m4a support.So, since PA#39;s tag reader already does correctly portray the values of the m4a genre field, I#39;d greatly appreciate if your "custom fast library implementation" would represent the tags correctly too.Thanks! PS: The only "solution" I#39;ve found to the problem is by sticking to the official ID3V1 and Winamp genre tags as they are listed here: http:www.id3.orgi... ... 0288d7c7e7Annoying, if one#39;s used to having custom genres but at least a workaround.];[Yes, the custom library will use faster version of current PowerAMP tag scanner, so genres will be display a bit more correctly comparing to the android library.];
larger buttons	Hello. Can you make small buttons in bottom rows (EQU, PRE, ADD TO PL, etc) larger? It#39;s very hard to tap on them on my SE X10 mini. Thanks.		13 November 2010 - 06:54 PM	divan	[Thank you for the response. Total customization for things like this will be available with the custom skins addition. Btw, while equ and pre buttons are small on qvga, add to pl and other menu buttons have actually larger hitbox (all their area including text below them is sensitive to presses).];
playlists	First of all thank you for creating Poweramp, its the best player on ANY smartphone including ones made by Apple... I do have a request - sorry if someone else has suggested it already or if its on your todo list.. is it possible to create playlists that can be used outside the app? by that I mean playlists that can be added to a homescreen (this can be done with the stock app on my Desire) loading the playlist also launches the app. Anyway, loving the app, please keep up the good work		13 November 2010 - 08:54 PM	gripweed	[Thank you for the request. It#39;s possible and I#39;ll be looking into this.];

lyrics easier	Hi, I have a suggestion. I think that the access to Lyrics button should be easier. Could have a configurable shortcut on the main view where with just one touch on the screen you would open the lyrics view. What do you think? I#39;m sorry if I am being a little boring about the lyrics support, but, I hope I am helping to improve the app. Thanks.		11 November 2010 - 11:16 PM	kildaryklein	[Thanks for the request. Lyrics will be improved in following ways: - - .lrc downloader.

landscape layout	I#39;d like to see the album art be bigger in landscape mode, both for aesthetics and to make gestures easier. How about putting only the art on the left half, and all the controls on the right half? The control layout could be just as they are in portrait mode, only with the buttons on the bottom. BTW - the landscape mode doesn#39;t say "Power Amp"		11 November 2010 - 03:01 PM	stand	[I tried Poweramp today and was thinking the exact same thing, a bigger album art in the landscape mode would be so much nicer! Similar to the portraitmode, if possible, because that one is perfect in Poweramp!!!];
shuffle play list	Is there a way to display a list of upcoming songs in a shuffled play order? Pressing on the song title in the player takes you to a list of all the songs on that album. I would rather see what songs are coming up in the shuffle order. I assume that you already know what songs are coming up, since the shuffle feature plays songs in a random order, it doesn#39;t just select the next song randomly. So how can I this? BTW - I like the option to shuffle in the current folder. I often hit a song from an artist I haven#39;t heard in a while, and think I#39;d like to hear a few more of their songs. Now I can just hit the shuffle button to stick with them for a while, and then hit it again to shuffle off to another artist. I don#39;t know if this was your idea originally, but it is brilliant.		11 November 2010 - 02:37 PM	stand	
lockscreen widget doesn#39;t appear if phone locks while paused	at the moment, if the user puts the player on pause (except from the lockscreen widget when the phone is already locked) and the phone gets locked, when the user returns to the lockscreen the lockscreen widget does not appear. If the user just wants to play music he has to unlock the phone first. Is it possible to have the lockscreen widget appear even if the player is paused, maybe as a setting? With this fix, the user can start or resume playback from the lockscreen at any time. thanks for reading.		10 November 2010 - 08:27 AM	nstyn4te	[Thanks for the request. Yes, this is done intentionally. It#39;s possible to make it always appear, optionally of course. Still, this won#39;t always work, as if Android shuts down the PowerAMP process, PowerAMP, of course, can#39;t detect the screen is on and show anything until started by user. So this will work fine on mid-to-high end phones, and not so great on lower end phones (or if you use automated task killer).];[well, obviously it won#39;t appear if the process isn#39;t actually on. Not much to do about that (aside from a "start on boot" option). As for task killers though, Poweramp seems to be a pretty stubborn process, always reappearing in the process list a few seconds after i kill it with process manager. If it#39;s the case that it#39;s effectively always on after you start it (which does seem to be the case), then the only time it won#39;t work is right after the phone reboots (a pretty infrequent occurrence i imagine) or maybe if the phone locks during the few seconds when the auto task killer has the process down (if you have one and don#39;t have the app on the ignore list). tl;dr, i figure that such an option should be useful close to all of the time.];[PowerAMP process started by Android automatically for events like mounted SD card. This always happens after phone boot (card is mounted and it#39;s not known if it was updated or not, so both system media scanner and PowerAMP scanner are started by OS). Other then this 1-5 sec scanning, there is nothing for PowerAMP todo in the background (when music is paused). Killing the process mean crashing it in unexpected moment - this causes db corruption. Also, Android thinks process crashed because of bug in it and restarts it. Android OS will shutdown the PowerAMP properly at the moment it needs more memory (though, it will start that killing from the processes which took more memory). There is no difference in battery life or cpu utilization if memory is filled with PowerAMP process or not. It makes difference though if you want to play something and PowerAMP was killed previously - process will start over, libraries will load again, a lot of initialization code will be ran by Android. This will consume batterycpu, obviously. Task killer may be useful on older Android revisions (1.51.6), but PowerAMP doesn#39;t run on these. Task killer may be useful for apps which do something in the background. PowerAMP has nothing to do in background when it#39;s paused, so it does nothing (sleeps).];[cool, thanks for clearing that up.];
listening history database favorites	I would really like to see a listening history interactive database added. With this in place it could provide the function of a "most listened to" tracks, "newly added" tracks, "least listened to". A "favorites" option could also be added to the app to allow you to taguntag songs as you listen to them as favorites and then have the option to play back favorite tracks in shuffle at any time. Some of these features are available in the iPodiTunes world and would be a very valuable addition to Poweramp. These types of features would make my experience with the app even better than it is now and also give the app added features that would make it stand above the rest even more than it already does. Thank you! Great App! I can#39;t wait to see what comes in the future.		10 November 2010 - 03:23 AM	kbelzowski	[Thank you for the request. Something like that is planned.];[Excellent];
unhide status bar on menu button press	Hi, I prefer to keep the statusnotification bar hidden while in Poweramp (much more pleasing, aesthetically). Would it be possible to have it displayed when the menu button is pressed, like it does in the EVO#39;s web browser? This way, you wouldn#39;t have to navigate away from Poweramp to view your notifications. Thanks and regards, -Jerry		10 November 2010 - 04:57 PM	JerryG	[Great idea!];[Hopefully this would be an option, as I prefer to keep mine visible at all time due to constant switching. I don#39;t spend much time looking directly *at* the music playing app, so hiding the bar would be more of an annoyance.];[Thanks for the request, I#39;ll be looking into this.];
configurable headset button combination presses?	Hi, On my PalmOS Treo, I had a utility program that worked along with Pocket-Tunes. It let you set up various button press combinations, for example - short press long press - raise volume n (you could specify the percentage) long press short press - lower volume n long press long press - previous song It also had a configurable time-out for the time between presses, and a confirmation beep.

saving equalizer preset	I#39;ll enjoy the possibility to save the custom equalizer setting as new preset. I don#39;t know if it is possible simply or not, but adding to an artist a preset, so that each time you play this artist, the equalizer is ajusted the best way!		02 November 2010 - 07:41 PM	mephisto	[Thanks for the request, yes, presets are in TODO for v2.0. I#39;m not sure about per artist binding, as this can be a bit complicated to manage for user.];[What you can do is give the possibility to modify by artist or album (ID3tag), and give in this interface the possibility to choose one existing preset...

gestures over album art - pause function	I#39;m definetely quiting the use of the buttons on this wonderful player.

an optional way of going backward down the list hierarchy	First of all I must say I#39;m very much impressed by Poweramp, especially its equalizer. It#39;s the first player that makes my android phone a worthy music player !To the point: I love the fact that in the #39;now playing#39; screen I can click on the table with the song title and progess bar in order to go back to the list of the current album. However, when I click on the up-arrow located in the top right-hand corner of the screen, it takes me to the general albums list, not the albums of the artist I was listening to. I think that it would be more logical this way: I#39;m listening to a song of artist X - click - Reviewing the album I am listening to - click - Reviewing albums of artist XThat way it will be easier to navigate among albums of the same artist. As for now, the quickest way to select a different album of the artist I#39;m listening to at a given moment is to click the menu button, click "folderslib", select "artists", find the desired artist and only then see the albums I wanted. What do you think? Of course, if someone prefers to use it the way it is now, this could be made optional in the settingsCheers		09 November 2010 - 02:20 PM	peterabelard	[Oh...I didn#39;t notice this, as I#39;m sure others haven#39;t, but what you mentioned does make more sense. What I did was go to Artist, albums of artist, pick a track to start. Then I click back and it shows me the tracks off of the *current* album with "Albums" being listed at the top. Click on the arrow, and you get dumped to the total albums list, with the current album in the middle of the screen. Interesting "bug," unless it was designed to do this.];[well it#39;s not necessarily a bug, but still, I think that the scheme I proposed is more intuitive Besides, I guess its much less frequent that you want to see all albums alphabetically , instead of browsing through the artist#39;s catalog. I hope it gets considered!];[Thanks for the report, please see my response here: viewtopic.php?f=4t=151];
track order vs. alphabetical order for albums	It would be great if the music on an album could be played in the track order that it was intended by the musician, rather than in alphabetical order. It is kind of weird listening to a live album when it is all jumbled up. Thanks!		09 November 2010 - 10:08 PM	Croooooow	[Thanks for the request. For albums songs (in library) it#39;s the default sorting order (track, then title). Of course if there is track # in the tags. You can tweak it further in PowerAMP settings - Sorting - AlbumArtist Songs Sorting. You can force track # only sorting there. For folder songs, purely file based sortings are used. I.e. PowerAMP uses numbers in the filename (in the beginning - like 01-track.mp3, or in the end, like track-01.mp3). Though, number length should be no more then 4 digits and the number shouldn#39;t be greater than 1000.];

adjustable widget opacity	this request is for a setting to adjust the opacity of the widget background. Right now I happen to be using a backgroundwallpaper against which the widget text below the track title is hard to read. Allowing for a lower opacityhigher transparency widget background would help strike a balance between transparency and readability. In case anyone#39;s curious, the background i#39;m using is a landscape photo with sky and water (read: mostly blue of varying shades). I figure this is a common enough type of background to make this a noteworthy issue.

now playing playlist direct button to library	Hi, thanks for a great player. As soon as I heard EQ working, I didn#39;t hesitate to shop for it. This app seems promising. I have two suggestions: 1) Playlist management is pretty poor at this stage. Although I don#39;t really use created playlists that much , I really miss Now Playing playlist, which is dynamically created on the go and holds tracks queued for listening. Also, currently the playlists are way too hidden, and I couldn#39;t figure out how to change order of songs in a given playlist ... probably it is not possible. 2) I miss button which would take me directly to the "root" folders menu, where I can pick folder to play. Right now this is possible only on two clicks, I think choosing different album deserves dedicated button. Thanks for great work		09 November 2010 - 09:00 PM	tealover

extra large album art widget	I#39;m really happy with this music player after trying many and after a fast forward option is added (sounds like it will be soon) it will be nearly perfect for me.

play all albums by artist	Currently when you select Play All in artist view (library) it sorts all songs by tack number. An option to play through albums in order would be a welcome addition.

album art choice	Hi, thanks for this great music player! But I have a questionrequest concerning the album art. Is it possible to choose from a variety of potential pics?

Thanks a lot!		07 November 2010 - 01:20 PM	kopfleuchten	
edit multiple tag	Hi By using your application, I thought of an other feature that could be helpfull: the possibility to change multiple tag. For exemple, when an album#39;s genre is tagged as "default", we have to change manually each song. Quiet annoying.

switch between album art and visualizations in widget	In the widget, It would be really cool to switch between album art and the built-in visualizations like the stock android player does.

customizable player screen	You see, Power AMP already has a beautiful interface, but sometimes it just feels like there are too many stuff on the screen. Because of the gestures, the forward and backward buttons get a little obsolete and its not like I use the equalizer all the time. We should be able to chose what to show on the player screen. If I want to see only the album art and the tagsfile and duration, so be it! It would be fantastic to have the player the way we like it.

clicking the quot;menu upquot; button when coming from main ui	So I#39;ve been playing around with the player for the past couple of hours, and I really love it and will definitely buy it, there is just one really small thing that would make this player, in my eyes, almost perfect: When on the main player screen, if you click on the little "list" button above the song name to go to the list of songs you own that are in the same album, and then click the up arrow button in the upper right corner to go to the next organizational level, it would be a lot easier if it went to the Artist instead of all owned albums (like, it should go to the artist the album was made by, with the list of the other albums you have by them). It does this if you use the library function to find your song, and then press the "menu up" button without going to the player screen, but once you do go to the player screen it will just go to a list of all albums, regardless of the artist. I know that this is a really small thing, but I feel like it allows for easier changes between songs, especially if you want to listen to a lot of songs by the same artist. I#39;m sorry if that made absolutely no sense, and I#39;ll clarify if needed. Otherwise I looooveeee Poweramp and thanks for developing such a great app!!		03 November 2010 - 10:16 PM	gdphan56	[Seconded. (I was literally just going to ask the same thing. Haha) Props on the greatest android music player ever! I will buy asap.];[Yes, I completely agree. Follow hierarchy. Library - Artist - Album - Song That would be an excellent change];[Thanks for the request. I#39;ll be looking into this issue. Right now PowerAMP follows standard android player approach and plays the whole album, not just the selected artist#39;s songs in the album. Changing it to playing the only the selected artists from the album may cause even more questionsrequests to change. Moving back to the artist from album won#39;t work for compilation albums. The one improvement that will be added to artist view (in one of the next minor releases) - is the ability to show all artist songs in a plain list, not sorted by albums. More Library changestweaks will be done when own Library will be implemented in v2.0.];[here maybe this is a better way to describe it, and this way might sidestep the problems you are talking about. would it be possible for Poweramp to memorize the hierarchy you used to get to a song, even after going to the player screen? iPods and iOS devices work this way i am pretty sure, and once again it just makes it easier to switch between songs. Again, thanks for making such an incredible app!];
feture requests amp; thank you : )	First, your app is amazing. Android needed a good music app, and this one seems to be better then the rest I have tried. Music being played out of the phones speaker now sounds much better. The widgets look great (simple clean, thank you!) and provide just the right options. Suggestions are as follows:A playlist button on the widgets. The two extra folder buttons on the widget are no longer there when I switched from playing tracks in folders to playlists. I would love to see those two buttons on the widget which are there in folder view also there in playlist view, but used cycle back and forward through your different playlists. It would be nice to see a shuffle button too on the widget to shuffle the current folderplaylist.I would love an option to use visualizations instead of album artwork. Being able to full screen visualizations would be nice too. I often hook up my Droid X to HDTV#39;s using the HDMI out (and Real HDMI App) then output music to the TV#39;s speakers. Trippy flashing colors, patterns, tunnels, designs, etc through visualizations would look great. See: http:www.winamp.comvisualizations I would love to see several different options.This next one may require a bug fix from google. Android (STILL) can#39;t display ID3v2 Genre tags correctly. We are stuck with the old ID3v1.1 Tagging which has premade genres and does not allow for custom tagging in the genre field. Ironically, ID3v2 came out back in the late 90#39;s well before Android was even a conceptual design.The lock screen really needs a swipe to unlock instead of a single button before it can replace the default phone lock screen. The button is just to easy to accidentally press which prevents using the apps option to replace its lock screen wo using the default one too. No need for redundancy if the button changes to a swipe type unlock (like the Android system one, iPhone, etc) The lock screen would be even better if you could select playlists.I would love an option to have the app automatically power down itself in event of low battery. This could be an option setting where the user can pick a certain phone battery level the app automatically shuts it self down.Gapless playback, crossfade songs, and a volume level check option (to playback all songs at the same volume, even if one mp3 is louder then the other one) would be great.Lastly an Exit button in the setting menu to shut the app down completely. I hat leaving apps running when not in use. Task killing it is a PITA.Thats all I can think of for now. Keep up the great work!		04 November 2010 - 10:09 PM	Thalinor

Any idea on when the V2.0 would be released? Thanks! PS: I NEED gapless, but I agree that gapless AND crossfade will be the best choice];[v2.0 release date depends on how much new features will be added to it (though, I#39;m trying to keep the player as simple as possible and not going to make a monster app), and how well v1.0 will be accepted by android community. I would say I already have planned TODO for a month of work.];
scrolling notification in status bar at song change	This is an awesome app and I really enjoy using it. I feel weird requesting a feature for an app that I haven’t paid for (hopefully I can soon…), but one thing that I’ve wished for in most music apps is that there would be a scrolling notification in the status bar at each song change which would contain the artist name and song title. Last.FM’s app does that and I really like it. Hopefully that makes sense… Handcent SMS does this as well when it receives a text (as I#39;m sure other messaging apps do). Thanks		03 November 2010 - 11:48 PM	derick03	[Thanks for the request. Probably will be added as option.];
move to memory card and more	Hi I love your music player, but I would really like to see these features: * Move to memory card (froyo) * When headset is connected and longpress on volume rocker you change to nextprevious song * A widget with white text and buttons (instead of the blueish glow) * Album art in the library list Keep up the good work! Oggeh		03 November 2010 - 09:18 PM	Oggeh	[- If the music player is moved to SD Card, you can#39;t use the widget anymore. - Album art are already in the library list...if your songs are correctly tagged :roll:];[* Bummer about the widget : * I#39;ve used Album Grabber to get some album art, and I see now that the album art doesn#39;t show when you are in a playlist (in the library)];[Thank you for the request.Yes, currently move to SD card feature has too many limitations. Inability to support Widgets is the one, but there are more - check http:developer.and... ... ation.html if you#39;re interested (Applications That Should NOT Install on External Storage).But it#39;s not impossible (widgets can go into separate app, which will be installed into internal memory) and I#39;ll be looking into this for v2.0.];
track order sorting for folders	I use "Folders" to play my FLAC music, but I currently have all my tracks named without their Track Numbers - this information is all in the Tag of the track. But currently there is no way to sort by Track number and as such my sort order is out of sync when playing by folder. sidenote I then tried to use the "Library" but that particular album did not appear - anyway to refresh the library? The re-scan folders doesn#39;t seem to have an effect for my library and FLAC files :? Thanks in advance and keep up the great product.		04 November 2010 - 11:32 AM	b0yce	[Folders is purely FolderFile based, it doesn#39;t process tags the way standard Library does. It can sort only based on file attributes (file number, file name, mod time). The Library view shows standard Android os media library. Non-standard file formats are supported in Folders only. This may change with the addition of custom Library in PowerAMP 2.0.];
button size#39;s	Terrific player, best I#39;ve seen! Some of the buttons are a wee small for my tired old eyes fingers, especially when driving. Quick access to #39;Playlists#39; on more screens would be nice. You are definately on the right track, and I#39;m eager to pay - Best, IM		04 November 2010 - 12:00 PM	Imageman	[Thanks for the request. Bigger buttons and other types of UI customization via custom3rd party skins are planned for v2.0.];
default music player presets	I love most of the features of Poweramp like the equalisers and tone controls, less gaps between songs, interface, etc. But I frankly still feel the quality or rather the preset equaliser settings in the stock music player is very good.. (i use the #39;Rock#39; equaliser and #39;Normal#39; effect in the stock music player).. Can you see what equaliser settings can give that same effect as I am not able to emulate it myself? In other words add the default music player equaliser settings in the presets of Poweramp.. For eg. When I set Samsung Rock default in Poweramp it will sound like the stock music player.. Thanks		03 November 2010 - 08:33 AM	praveen6585	[Thanks for the request. Unfortunately, there are no "stock" presets for android platform - the devices which implement own equalizer - they all do this differently. Though, more presets will be available in one of the next minor releases, and customizable presets - in next major release.];[Oh yes.. I forgot that there are no standard presets for android.. Thanks for the reply though... Looking for the final version to be launched!];
wired remote triple-click support?	The latest version added double-click support, which is great. Would it be possible to extend that to triple click-support? In the other app bTunes, it accepted input from my wired headset wherein single-click playpause, double-click forward one track, and triple-click skip backwards one track. I loved this functionality, and it worked just fine with my old iPhone headset with wired micremote. I#39;m not sure about how the implementation works, but if double-click is supported just fine, and triple-clicking to rewind worked in another app, hopefully it#39;s not impossible to incorporate into Poweramp Congrats on the great app and big publicity. Looking forward to being able to send some money your way when the app is officially released. Thanks man! P.S. I will sacrifice many livestock in your honor when v2.0 rolls around with gapless playback :]		03 November 2010 - 03:07 AM	loomer	[I think the button clicking functionality is in the FAQ.];[Yo fauxfreshness thanks for the reply. I peeped at the FAQ and saw the section that you#39;re referring to, but I guess my original question is a little different than that. For those of us using wired remote headsets designed to work with iPhones, the only usable button is the middle-click that is currently used to pauseplay and skip forward. I guess a better way to phrase the original request is the ability to do playpause, skip forward, and skip backward all with that one button. Again, I remember that this was hard-wired into bTunes (which is generally a pretty iffy player, heh...) probably to try and adhere to the iPod experience as much as possible. Hopefully it#39;s something that can be incorporated into Poweramp too. I#39;m sure it would make more people happy than just me :]];[Thanks for the request. Better customization of headset buttons will be available in next major version. As for plain triple click support - I#39;m adding it to TODO for next minor release (it will require double click option enabled in the PowerAMP settings.];
volume control on wired remote control	Hi, Thanks for a great music player. I#39;m waiting for the final version to buy it, because it really notice the effort and dedication you put into it. I would like to request a feature, I saw that in this latest release, has implemented the function of double click on the wired remote control to skip forward or backward a song, I asume that#39;s to avoid accidental touches. I think it would be more useful if this will work to raise and lower the volume on the player, in that way it would not be necessary to remove the phone from the pocket or whereever it is to access this feature. If you need beta testers, please let me know ! Regards, PS: Translated from Spanish by Google Translator me		03 November 2010 - 01:12 PM	Cadorna	[Thanks for the request. You can read about current remote buttons support in PowerAMP FAQ here - viewtopic.php?f=1t=20 As for customizable action binding to headset buttons, this is in TODO for v2.0];
stop at the end of a folder	If the last track in a folder has been played, the player automatically starts playing the first song of the next folder. It would be great to have the possibility to choose in the settings, if the player plays the next folder or if the player stops playing at the end of the folder (and jumps back (paused) to the first song of the played folder - like a cd in the cd-player)		02 November 2010 - 07:34 PM	tourist	[Thanks for the request. I#39;m adding this to my TODO list, sounds like an useful option.];
voice search?	This thing seems to have everything else I want (except the ability to be purchased ), but it would be cool if it registered itself as a voice search handler. That way, you can say "listen to (artistalbumsong)" and it would come up to handle it. Thanks!		01 November 2010 - 02:51 PM	fauxfreshness	[+1];[Thanks for the request. Currently, PowerAMP is mostly focused on its Folders mode, and voice search like that definitely need to look in Library, which is system Library for now. It#39;s hard to properly pronounce full path and filename, which are the main song identification for Folders mode ;-) When new fast replacement for System library will be added to PowerAMP, it will be possible to do more advanced searches, and hook the voice search (of course, if android apis allow that).];
sleep timer!!!	please add sleep timer like mort player. just set certain time and Poweramp stops playing by itself. think that would be great!! thanks for your hard work MAX!! will buy for sure!!		02 November 2010 - 12:43 AM	drancid	[Thanks, sleep timer is planned for next major release (v2.0).];
sort library by album artist	This would be an awesome feature as many albums have artist written in different ways or featuring artists and so on. + the whole various artists albums can really clog up the list of artists. For instance I have Dr Dre - 2001. But if I scroll to Dre under Artists it shows as 20 lines Dr Dre, Snoop DoggDr. Dre, Eminem and so on. Whit Album Artist sorting this would show as only Dr. Dre. Click it and you can see his albums. When playing you can show the artist of the individual song. This is my dream. Fulfill it please?		02 November 2010 - 07:40 AM	gober	[??, I plan to implement own Library for some of the next major releases of PowerAMP. Own library was actually planned for first release, but given the time it required to implement, I decided to go with the System Library. Custom PowerAMP library will be fast and it will support all the tweaks we can#39;t get from System library, for example - optional smarter artist grouping.];
lyric show please	this Great Application for Android, the Best I think.... it would be Great if this app can show the Lyric, this app already can read the ID3 lyric tag .????, now its time to show the lyric, scrolling lyric please, with album art as a background...??? sorry for my poor english....		01 November 2010 - 01:57 AM	coetrix	[Lyrics download please like as album art but separatelly files not in tag. Anyway this is greate app.];
delete after listening (for podcasts)	I would love to use Poweramp as my primary media player. The only thing stopping me from doing so is that I listen to far more podcasts than I do music tracks. It would be very useful for managing podcasts if there were an option to have them auto delete after listening. Thank you for your excellent app.		01 November 2010 - 09:53 PM	jpurv	
wma with drm	I can#39;t tell from the feature list whether Poweramp can play DRM-protected WMA files or not. Anyone know the answer? If not, it would be great if this feature were added.		01 November 2010 - 07:46 PM	Lightguide	[No, this is not supported by FFmpeg atm.];[OK thanks. Bummer.];
mediamonkey meta tag support	Please consider adding support for mediamonkey#39;s meta tags. * Read and update last played field * Read and update played count field		01 November 2010 - 08:08 PM	d1v	
gestures in lockscreen	hi, I am really searching for a good Music Player. I used always btunes because it has this great feature of showing in fullscreen the current song. I found your great player and it does the same which is really nice. Still the Library an Folder Buttons are really small, and I have to check if it recognises my Playlists, but there is one big feature I am missing. The gestures while playing a song are awesome but it would be more awesome if this would work also on the lockscreen. Because I am jogging a lot and I know it from the Samsung Player, my old Iphone and so on, when you are on the run and want to get to the next Song you have to search with your finger the NEXT Button on the Screen. The normal Samsung Player doesn#39;t have a Lockscreen Widget at all, and on the iPhone it was always difficult to press exactly the NEXT Button while running. btunes made it really good and allowed with a swipe to left or right to play the next or last song. This was amazing while running, because it was so smooth and easy, without looking on the screen. The problem is btunes lost his developers or anything, because since may there wasn#39;t any update and it has really big difficulties with Froyo. therefore I am back to Samsung Player and now putting all my hope into Power AMP. The widget is still a good think, but the final point whould be the gestures on the lockscreen. would be nice but I buy it anyway if it hits the market		01 November 2010 - 07:41 PM	TweetyPeety	
edit playlists	A feature I would like to see that I have only seen consistently work in winamp. There are times when I want to move songs around in a playlist and have to switch players to do it. The stock player does it as well but sometimes gets buggy.		01 November 2010 - 07:28 PM	y2whisper	
editing	Able to edit any song tags.		01 November 2010 - 08:53 AM	rainman6969	[Thanks for the request, but this is already implemented. Unless you mean any possible tag, not any song )];
music formats	I do not have any problems with formats.		01 November 2010 - 08:51 AM	rainman6969	
album art settings	Have album art settings,( able to select sd folder for album art.		01 November 2010 - 08:49 AM	rainman6969	
custom eq#39;s door each song	Custom EQ#39;s for each song		01 November 2010 - 08:47 AM	rainman6969	
playlist shortcuts to home screens	It would be nice to have shortcut for playlists, and if they would have options to auto play as soon add you click them.		01 November 2010 - 08:45 AM	rainman6969
