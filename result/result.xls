prefer embedded album art on a per track basis	Hi all, Ive got several albums worth of commercially purchased MP3s, where an image is embedded in each track in a kind of high-tech liner notes artwork deal. At the moment, only a single track is scanned, and this is used as a cached image for the whole album, so you never see the other images. Is it possible to add an option to disable album art caching, to force a check of "album" art for each track?	album art,tag,screen,display
car profile	Hi, Im using Poweramp on a nexus7 in my car. It works, but it would be easier to operate if we could choose a variation of the interface with bigger controls and fonts. Also a big volume control on screen all the time would be very handy. Big horizontal sliding volume control. In a car and driving is important to have big controls. I always press the wrong button! thanks	volume,album art,bluetooth,tag

music frequency progress bar and others	I tried them all (literally), Poweramp is the best and most powerful music player on android. But, of course, it could be better. 1. Search results shorting. Usually it shorts closest match for albumsgt;artistsgt;songs. But I like to see closest songsgt;artistsgt;albums. I know this is too personal, but it really annoys me. At least a simple "search shorting options" under settings would be great. 2. A-B loop playback. This is a main absence on a pro music player like Poweramp. 3. Music frequency progress bar (like soundcloud). I saw it on a concept music player app and just loved it. You can actually see the song and skip the lower or higher frequencies with one click. Great idea for both design and function. 4. Lyrics. Its not functional on current version. When you open a song lyrics from tag, you say goodbye to the player. Can you add a transparent and scrollable layer on album art area for lyrics? And an option under settings or "options" menu to "show lyrics" (if available)? Thank you for reading.	lyrics,tag,display,album art

group by album artist compilation support	Sorry if Im the hundredth person to request this, but after moving to Android from iOS (which admittedly took far too long to implement it on their end too), one thing I definitely miss is being able to primarily display album artists for compilations. As such my artists list is cluttered with artists that only have one song in my library. Being able to hide these would making browsing much faster.	artist,library,playlist,sort
please add support for various itunes tags	Could support for the following tags be added: Album Artist: For albums that should be listed under a different name than the artist on some or all of the tracks. For instance, a Syd Barrett compilation may have tracks by Pink Floyd and by Syd Barrett; the songs "Artist" tags should have the correct respective artist, but the entire album should be shown as by Syd Barrett.Compilation: For "Various Artists" releases. This would enable compilations to appear at the end of the album listing, showing "Various Artists" as the artist. It would also fix the related problem where if you now have two albums with the same name, they appear as one album in the album listing. This behavior would no longer be necessary if it only combined tracks that had the "Compilation" tag set. Artist Sort and Album Artist Sort: So that artists can be sorted by last name. Album Sort: Not as necessary as the others, but would still be useful in some instances. Thanks#33;	artist,sort,tag,album artist

multiple artistgenre tag support#33;	There are always songs which have multiple artists, and similarly one song can have elements of multiple genre. MediaMonkey on my PC does a nice job of supporting these multiple tags by separating the tags by a semicolon, and syncs them to my GS2 as such as well. Androids default player, as well the my GS2 player, and all other major players dont have support for these multiple tags. So what happens is that I end up getting, as an example, three different artists - "Shaggy", "Akon" and "Shaggy;Akon". Since there is no single artist by name "Shaggy;Akon", it doesnt get a picture and music library just falls apart. Can you please parse these multiple tags properly and add one song under multiple artistsgenres in the library depending on if the tag has multiple artistsgenres. Thank you#33;	playlist,tag,artist,id3
ratings and mediamonkey tags	People are putting more and more music on their smartphones and some people even use their Android Phones and tablets as PC replacements and their primary music player .... What is missing is the ability to view the ratings of tracks before you choose them to play. Displaying the rating as the track is being played isnt really useful at all. So my request is: 1) Display the rating of tracks in the library view. For example ....... I open Poweramp, choose the Album Tab and then see a listing of albums, I tap an album "Best of Elton John" and see a listing of all the tracks on that album plus the rating for every track at the same time. I then easily pick the best tracks. 2) Properly read Media Monkey tags, preferably all of them ..... It can be done .....	playlist,tag,option,library

edit playlist in poweramp?	Hello, members of this Forum! I have a short question: How can I edit (spc. delete) the entries in my play list of Poweramp? I want to tell you exactly what I mean: I use the full version of Poweramp on a Galaxy S3! I have created a new (first) playlist called "standard". In the meantime the playlist contains 35 titles. Is it possible to delete some of these titles and HOW can I do this? I cannot find an option for that. If I choose the option "playlist" from the main option menu, I get an overview over my playlists (here f.e. "standard"), but I cannot edit it. It is also impossible to delete the whole playlist. Can someone give me an advice? Many greetings from Germany UweBast	playlist,option,lock screen,delete

ability to remove player from notification area	Been a long time fan and faithful user of PA! First post here to your forums because Im finding frustration with a feature (setting). Im trying to remove the player from the notification bararea. Heres why.... I have a setting on my ROM (Xylon) that allows the notification bar to be hidden unless a notification comes in. This is perfect for my minimalist and highly custom home screen design. However, when using PA (which is all the time), the notification bar is visible because the PA icon is there. If I swipe down my notification, the player is there and I can control it as needed. I would like to see that feature be an option in the notification bararea. I see in settingslook and feelstatus barnotification "Notification Priority" where I can define the notification position. However, if I set this to minimum (the lowest setting), it removes the icon from the notification bar but the player still remains in the notification area which keeps my notification bar visible. So the option would need to be such that you can choose if you want the player in the notification area or not. Love the player.....its the only one Ill ever use Cheers!

rich notification customization (jelly bean)	Hello, Id like to ask for some customization options for the new Jelly Bean style rich notification (see a screenshot under the spoiler). The first option is to disable the tracks counter ("360369") because it takes quite a lot of space needed for long trackartist+album names, and I dont actually need this counter. Also, when it is displayed, it could be placed in line with track name or artist+album instead of covering both lines. The second option is to choose an album art transition animation, or at least to disable the current "zoom in - zoom out" animation. Thank you. Spoiler	version,button,album art,update

multiple file operations	Hi, I must say Im very happy with Poweramp. For my needs its almost perfect. One thing that has been sorely missing though is the ability to perform some operations for more filesfolders at once. Most notably these should include enqueing, adding to playlist, deletion and playlistqueue manipulation. Is there a chance this could be implemented? I imagine a multi-operation switch similar to the queue-manipulation switch in queue view could be added to all views which upon activation would show checkboxes to the left of filenames and any operation performed would apply to the whole selection of files. It wouldnt really clutter up the interface and would be hugely beneficial. Thanks for considering this! Petr	playlist,tag,queue,display

multiple artists	Hello, at the Moment I always used free Apps for playing Music, but I am looking for a better app for it. But I am looking for one special feature before i buy an app. What I am looking for is a feature for multiple Interprets, so that I can find a Song by different Artist. For Example I have sort my Songs like "Artist 1; Artist 2" and I wish the Song would Display by the Songs of Artist 1 and by the Songs Of Artist 2 and not by "Artist 1; Artist 2". Is It possible to add this feature? (Sorry for my English, its been a while since I had it at school... but I hope you know what I need) ;-)	artist,sort,playlist,album
please add more support for whole album listeners	Hi there, Poweramp is a quite good player, but for me it lacks some important features as I am only listening to complete album (I know, very old school behaviour). For example the "recently added" list is only song based, which is absolutly irrelevant to me. I#180;d like to see which albums I recently added and add it as a whole and not file by file to my playlist. As well there should be a album oriented playlist or at least album related operations on playlists like removing complete albums and so on. Hopefully somethings like this can be seen in some of the next releases. Regards Motorpsycho	playlist,album,album art,sort

gui and widget suggestions	Greetings, I have a few ideas for possible improvements to Poweramp that might make for a more enjoyable experience for users like myself. 1. Swipe widget support - I rely on the swipe gesture to change tracks in the car so being able to use that with the widget would be great. Im not much of a widget user but my recent deck upgrade makes it more viable. I love how customizable the widget pack is but the gesture support would really bring it to another level. 2. Rearrange the landscape button placement - Having the back and forward buttons stacked on the right side makes it very difficult to utilize their functions, especially while driving. Its such a small area and I almost always miss my intended target. If there was an option to rearrange how the meta data and art are arranged, the landscape interface would be more user friendly. Id love the option of moving the art over to the left and putting the meta data to its right, much like the older version of Google Play Music (Im not sure how the new version works; it crashes on my phone before I ever get a chance to try it). 3. More customization options for the interface - The widget is highly tweakable and Id like to see more of those options show up in the full app. Even just being able to adjust the opacity of the track infoprogress bar and the text style of that info would be a huge improvement. I havent looked into skinning and whats possible with that so maybe these issues arent even rooted in Poweramp but rather the themes. If custom skins can alter the layout, Ill look further into that option. Im sure some of these have been requested before but I dont recall seeing them when I looked through recent posts. At any rate, Id love to see some of these implemented in future releases. Also, voice commands would be excellent but that has been requested quite a bit. ;-) All the best, TheJacksonCinco	equalizer,all,repeat option,last played

additional volume steps	Ello.As you know, Android has 16 media volume steps and Im sure plenty of people experienced the occasion where one step up and the music gets too loud, while one step down and it gets too quiet. The explanation given here is a fair point, as well as the EQ solution, but were pretty late here into the modern age and Poweramp seems mature enough to handle such a thing.Currently Im using an app called Fine Volume Control which is clumsy and overall feels like money down the drain just to cover up for the OSs lack of features. Anyhow, thats the suggestion. I think 48 steps and above should do the trick.Also, great app. Well worth the fee.	video,volume,button,screen

simple thing that will make the difference.	First off, I am in love with your app. You guys rock, no doubt about it. Here are a few things that will make it even more better ( from my point of view and the way i am using it): - Add to queue button beside each songfolder (single tap type of thing). It will be more simple than hold the songfolder and then tap on add to queue. - Resume song after a phone call has be accepted or made. I do have a remote on my earphones but for people who dont have it, it will be great that it resume the song that was playing before the phone call. Thats all for now. Thanks a lot.

critical feature - quot;listen toquot; google voice support!	I am not talking about a button that is built into the app itself, but using the voice search on your phone (that is used for nav, internet searches, voice dial, etc) by saying "Listen to..." and then speaking the Album, Title, etc. There is some piece of code needed in the player app for Googles voice search to recognize. I am sure somewhere on the android dev forums is how to add this feature. As of now there are only 5 different players (Pand, Slkr, mSpot, Rdio, and one other) that work with Googles voice search; in fact even the default music player written by google will not come up as an option (as of yet). On their home page Google lists the five software players the do work with this feature. Not only will adding this feature be amazing, but it will get your software on a very short list of android music players Google has listed on their site! IMO if you can bang out an update for your player quickly, you will benefit from the free advertising on Googles webpage, which I am sure you realize would be quite beneficial when your app goes paid.	control,voice control,voice,button

DLNA is supported by almost every device at our homes, pc, tv, console etc.. Wouldnt it be nice to have such feature in Poweramp? It takes ages with standard player because it is so dumb, it adds also ringtones or navi sounds to library where Poweramp is better because of folder filtering. Also it makes no sense to switch from Poweramp to stream something with standard player. Is it possible to add such feature? Somebody with me on this request? Peace.	stream,network,nas,version

ability to set notification priority and more	Hi, It would be very useful if you added the feature that could set the priority of Poweramps notification widget. I use Power Toggles app that allows you to perform a lot of stuff via single notification widget locked on top. However, when I play music via Poweramp, its notification extrudes the Power Toggles one and goes on top. Not only it is on top, but it is also expanded thus taking a lot of space. Please, take this into account because both apps are great and cannot be substituted. Also tried similar app - Notification Toggles, but thing was the same... As an additional feature you could include the ability to choose between expandable and non-expandable widgets.	shuffle,control,widget,repeat

exclude a folder from shuffle	My standard settings are to have Poweramp operate with shuffle set to all as this turns my player into a large random jukebox.

Currently the only option seems to be to add all my music to a play list, which would take a while and have to be done everytime I add a new set of tracks. As I have 200+ albums, but only 1 folder of pod casts it would be easier to exclude the pod casts. Thanks	playlist,folder,library,shuffle

audiophile or non-distortion mode for eq	Currently the EQ allows for both positive and negative adjustment of levels. Id love to have an Audiophile Non-Distortion mode for the EQ that starts with all of the sliders at ZERO across the top of the screen and only allows for negative adjustments. Increasing levels on an EQ causes distortion in any bands that are pushed above the flat range. It is preferable, and instantly renders better sound quality, to only lower bands that you do not want to hear as much of. By using this mode of the EQ you would also allow users to make more finite adjustments to the sliders as their full sliding area will be dedicated to only the negative range. This idea struck me after realizing that there is really no practical purpose for moving your sliders above flat. Its just wasted real-estate. I do realize however that many people who do not understand how EQs work are used to being able to boost things and will not react well to having this ability removed. For this reason I think it would be a great option and not a default.	equalizer,version,playlist,volume

Sure I could use the library view, but as it doesnt support album artist it is useless to me and so I have to use the structure of folders. By the way, my folder structure looks like: Music Albumartist ( are sorted alphabetical and should stay so) albums ( are sorted alphabetical and want them to be sorted by year) songs	sort,library,folder,artist
times played for trackssongs	I love Poweramp and its the only one Ive found with Left-Right balance option that doesnt suck, but it doesnt keep track of how many times each track has been played, like with Apple products and many other apps. Please include this, it would be very nice to see	playlist,option,display,album
full screen mode for album art	I would like to be able to select a full screen mode for album art. I have a 10" Transformer and I travel alot. It would be nice not to see any controls visible and the cover art as large as possible to take advantage of the large screen. Swiping to the next song would still be possible. A tap in the corner would bring back the controls. Thanks	album art,screen,display,tag
embedding downloaded album art in id3-tag	Hi there,I really love the sound quality and style of Poweramp. Nice work#33; Almost all my mp3s have an embedded album art. (I used droid3tagger) But I prefer the CD-Cover (Single) over the album art for some of my songs. So I deleted the album in the ID3-Tag and search the CD-Cover through Poweramp. Works.But whenever I restart the player or edit the ID3-Tag the old embedded album art shows up again. (Yes I checked "prefer downloaded album art over embedded") For the future updates:Is it possible to embed the downloaded album artsingle art directly with Poweramp? It would take less time than using foobar2000.Its super nice that you can download album arts through Poweramp. But its a pity that the downloaded album art neither is embedded nor saved somewhere you can export it.	album art,tag,screen,search
beats audio compatability	Hello, I have been a fan of power amp for over three years and it has worked flawlessly. I recently upgraded my phone to the HTC droid DNA. I have been having a couple of issues with the lockscreen widget Woking at all times when unlocking the device. Sometimes it will show, and other times it wont. But what I am most importantly conerned with is that when I am playing music through power amp and beats audio is enabled, I get a message telling me to turn it off because power amp isnt yet compatible with "beats" audio. Do you know when it will be?	version,lockscreen,playlist,screen
clock position on lock screen	Wonderful app - best music player Ive tried (and Ive tried loads)#33; Just one tiny niggle - the Lock Screen. Is it possible to have the clock at the top of the screen with the artwork immediately below rather than side by side? This should allow the artwork to be larger - its difficult to make out sometimes when driving. Would be prepared to sacrifice the date if that makes it easier	lock screen,option,screen,album art

the back button	Let me know if anyone agrees with me on this. The back button takes me back to my homescreen, but all Android phones have some type of homescreen button already on the phone. Would it be possible for my back button to take me back to the previous page? Heres an example: I click on Artisis A Day to Remember All Songs The Downfall of Us All If I wanted to go back, Id have to hit menu, then repeat the same thing over again to get to the band where instead it could go: The Downfall of Us All All Songs A Day to Remember Artists Thanks, nklenchik	button,playlist,library,screen
master pause iconbutton for bluetooth playback	Hello, Well done to you for creating this already excellent player Here is a suggestion to overcome a small issue, that Im sure others may have experienced: Would it be possible to incorporate a master pause button in Poweramp and its lock screen, that overrides bluetooth AD2P control commands "Play " without interfering with the phone function? Normally when driving with bluetooth selected on the car stereo, Poweramp will start playing. I am able to view the artist info and use steering wheel controls to select next track. If a phone call comes through (car has hands free kit built in the stereo), Poweramp pauses then resumes at the end of the call. This works nicely. If I have navigation software (navigon) running at the same time, the voice from the navigation blends in over the music. The audio level for this can be adjusted independently. There are times when driving I dont want any music, however still wish to use the navigator (navigon) and hear the directions over bluetooth. The problem is if power amp is manually "paused" it immediately starts playing again. If I quite Poweramp using the task manager, power amp will automatically start up again and resume. The only way to overcome this is to make a audio track called "silence" and tell Poweramp to repeat that track. There are no options in the car stereo to pause a "bluetooth audio player", the only time it will pause is when receiving a call, listening to cd or radio. Turning the volume down in Poweramp unfortuntly has the effect of reducing the navigator audio level. It appears Poweramps volume adjusts the "master volume", rather than having its own independant control. I would have though a master pause IconButton would work, the bluetooth audio channel is shared (phone calls are also channelled). This master pause, could be cancelled by hitting the next button on the steering wheel, should you decide a little music is in order after all#33; What do you think? Thanks Jonathan.

video suport for music videos (flv) on album art	Hi, first things first, congratulations on making the greatest portable music player, theres no other one near. Mainly I use Poweramp on my galaxy note 2 and razr as a monitor for my sony bt car stereo, and the sync is awesome, media butons work as expected and even prints the id3 tag of the current playing song, Im happy. But, my music library is mainly built of flv music videos and when played trough Poweramp it wont show either albumart or the video, this is expected as is not a video player, I know, my suggestion is to let Poweramp (as an option) play videos on the same area as the album art as a background, i will not be ment for watching movies (so theres no need for advanced video or subtitles options) but confortably enjoing music videos, not even fullscreeen is requested,	video,album art,display,bluetooth

Anthos EDIT Despite searching before posting (I really did#33;), I just found a previous feature request so I apologize for posting the same request.	widget,display,album art,option

instant filtering	When listening to a song, I would like the ability to press somewhere (or even using the menu) and have the option to instantly filter on the artist or album. Im open to other filtering categories. Scenario: Im listening with shuffle all songs settings. A song comes on from a particular artist, and now I want to hear more songs just from that artist. This feature would allow me to create an instant filter so that only songs from that artist are played from that point forward. Scenario: Listening to songs, a song comes on that is part of a compilation album, and I want to hear the other songs on the same album. Using this feature, I can quickly filter out all other songs except for the ones on this album.	screen,search,filter,playlist

All these features currently exist in Music Player Pro for Android (but it lack all the EQ functionality of Poweramp.)Keep up the good work.	playlist,album art,artist,album
smooth menu scrolling (like zplayer wp8 zune app)	Hello Poweramp forum, Recently I downloaded a cool Android music player called ZPlayer that recreates the UI experience of the WP8 music player (found on Windows Phone devices). I was amazed when downward Scrolling through the list of my songs,albums,genres etc...I was amazed at the sheer smoothness replicated to this Android app which made me think that I would like to experience the same scrolling smoothess for Poweramp too. I am currently using Poweramp 2.0.8-build-516 and ZPlayer v3.2.03 on my Samsung Galaxy S3 stock ROM Android 4.1. I hope others here can sample ZPlayers smooth scrolling and support it being added to Poweramp.

remote control of poweramp over network andor bluetooth	I would like to be able to control Poweramp from a remote device (pc, other tablet, other phone) over the network. Preferably with an advanced front-end applet on the other device. Currently I have connected a low cost Android tablet to my AV-receiver through HDMI. (That is digital out, the AV-receiver has much better DACs than the tablet.) I am planning on using this tablet as a HTPC. Other people may use a Google TV box. Now I would like to be able to control it from the couch.	bluetooth,version,screen,control

browse by genre...then by artist....then by album.	Hi there. There are a few scattered posts here and there regarding adding an update to the app that would allow one to browse by genre, then by artist (without having to see all the albums), then by album. This is an aspect of music browsing that hardly any Andriod app offers, but has been a standard on iOS since the beginning and its one of the things I really miss. I love everything else about Poweramp, but what would make it perfect for me is to offer this, since I basically always browse my music by genre. its pretty annoying to have to scroll through the list of all the albums each time (and the current alphabetic scrolling in Poweramp doesnt work, even when the list is sorted by artist, because its still paying attention to the album names, not the artist names). In other posts, the developers have said that this was a feature planned for version 2.0, but it hasnt made it in yet. Any updates on whether this is still in the works? Thanks#33;#33;	sort,playlist,artist,album
sort playlist by play count	Hello, it would be great to have the feature to sort a playlist by play count. I know the function "often played" in the library but this is not what I want.

ignore articles in lists	A feature that would allow us to ignore the articles in song titles, albums, artist names would be appreciated. As it stands a lot of my songs are clumped at "the".

Thanks	artist,shuffle,queue,repeat
import ratings from id3 tags to the poweramp database	Looking for a feature that would import all the ratings I have in my ID3 tags (Media Monkey on my desktop) to the Poweramp database.

hearing music and incoming calls problems	Hi there, I am very satisfied with the Poweramp App. Best Music-Player in Play-Store#33; But, there is a "BUT"... Something this is annyoing me pretty much and I am over 90 sure, that this wasnt the fact in earlier versions of Poweramp: When I am hearing music via headphones (without a microphone or other fancy stuff) and a call comes in, the music stopps, I unplugged my headphones, answering the call and when the call ends, the music suddently plays on with or without the earphones are plugged in again. So, when I am not fast enough, everybody can hear my music very loud, before I am able to reconnect the earphones. That is embarrasing, especially when I am on the crowdy train to work or somewhere in public. So I had turned off the option now, to start the music again after call. But then, I have to restart the player, what is not so embarrasing but still annoying. As far as I can remember, that werent a problem in earlier version of Poweramp. There the music was paused untill I reconnected the earphones after a call. So, my request is, to reimplement that very nice feature again#33; I am using a Samsung Galaxy S 1 (GT-I9000) with Android 2.3.5. Poweramp is on version "2.0.8-build-524 Full Version"	sound,screen,version,mix

Thanks.	playlist,button,screen,artist
awesome beats mod compatibility	There is this popular mod that ports the libraries for Beats audio into other devices, called Awesome Beats, such as this one for Nexus 7: http:forum.xda-dev...d.php?t=1889522 I know that for Beats to be enabled in Poweramp, it needs to be turned on in the ToneVol settings tab, which wont show up unless it is on HTC devices. Do you think it is possible to show this button on non-HTC devices as long as the libs are present? The mod is popular enough that it is ported to many devices. Im pretty sure this will please a lot of users.	button,sound,srs,version

My brother cant hear out of one ear so whenever he listens to headphones, he only gets half of the mix. Would it be possible to work a balance or pan control into the EQ settings? Or to make an option to combine the stereo channels into a mono mix? Thanks again.	option,control,screen,volume
volume slider on main screen and bookmarks	What really would be nice is (as the title says) a volume slider on the main screen, next or under the album art. That would be specially useful for people who use Poweramp on tablet with really small, half-hidden buttons (Im looking at you, Motorola Xoom). Also, a bookmarking function could really be interresting when you listen to audiobooks with Poweramp. having to remember that you left at chapter number 676436, 59.35 minutes an really be annoying.	screen,volume,button,album art
volume knob on main screen	Im a reasonably new Poweramp user - best player Ive used.

my requests	HiIt#8217;s done, I finished my 14 days trial period today (with build 512) and I bought Poweramp just after receiving the end of period notification without hesitation I tested several players and Poweramp is my favorite by far, however I#8217;ve some requests that I would like to be implemented in future versions: - Manage #8220;Album Artist#8221; tag. Already discussed here. In album view we should be able to sort Album by #8220;Artist Album#8221;. This sorting must prevent to concatenate Album with identical name but different Artist (ex #8220;Greatest Hits#8221;), or to see #8220;Various artist#8221; in case of Compilation CD. This is clearly a Must have A specific view should be available for #8220;Album Artist#8221; similar to #8220;Artist#8221;. Should Have Note: folder view may help for the time being but in my view it#8217;s an unsatisfactory solution - Improve Navigation amp; Ergonomy I find the global navigation a little bit #8220;messy#8221;. For example I#8217;m not found of having the possibility to get direct access to folder view at the bottom of the screen when you have chosen library. Should Have. Instead I would have preferred to be able to access genre and artist views. Swipe right or left should be implemented to change from one view (ex Album) to another (ex Artist) Should Have In landscape mode, on play view, I#8216;d rather have the album art in one side and the control buttons on the other to see larger album art and better screen usage. Should Have On play view if you want to go back to complete album list you have to press on #8220;album icon#8221; first on bottom of the screen, then back to album arrow "lt;" on top of the screen. Not very user friendly. See also #8220;note#8221; just after Note: It may be a bug but I noticed on play view when pressing long on #8220;album icon#8221; a context menu is displayed. If you press album view you go back to the song list of the album instead of complete album list. Shoud have - Grid view Enlarge slightly the picture. To save space beetwen album arts Insert text (Album amp; artist name) over the Album art instead of below (or offer the possibility to completely remove the text). Should have . Offer the possibility to customize the number of Colum or define the size of album art. Nice to have - Keep Screen On Additional condition should be possible : Keep Screen on only when connected to power supply Should Have - Language Make French available (It#8217;s not an issue for me but could be if you want to develop your product in France). Should Have Is there someone that already work on the French translation? Or do you need Help? Skin I use free ICS skin but I#8217;d like to have a Jelly Bean skin. Quite similar actually but one difference I noted in Jelly Bean is the sceen background has a dark grayblack scale instead of pure black. Nice to Have Lock Screen Change slider to ICS or JB fashion.

I love the Cover Flow from Google Music and a similar feature would be fantastic for Poweramp. It would go where the album art currently is. In addition, the cover flow could also show the currently-playing (and next) TitleArtistAlbum information in line with each album cover (as seen in the picture below). Or, you could keep the tradition info display and just use the cover flow for album art images. http:i1125.photobu...05-21-04-49.png	album art,cover,tag,view

edit tags improvements	Seems like itd be a great feature to have the ability to edit general pieces of information about your music such as Artist and Album titles, without having to click on each song and changing it individually. Personally, i get music from a wide variety of sources oncluding iTunes, datpiff, and livemixtapes. Occasionally, album titles are messed up, being typed in all caps or spelt wrong, whatever the case may be. So i try to keep my library as uniform as possible and this can take up a good chunk of time, depending on how many songs there are and the degree of editing i have to do. Maybe when you hit the arrow thing next to a song and tap "infotags", youre given the option to change multiple or just that one, using a checkmark as a selection tool. Also, the ability to just go to the next or previous song in a list instead of saving and repeating the process for the next track. Also would be quicker to use. Thoughts?	playlist,tag,library,artist

play once setting for musicians and theatre use	Many musicians andor theatre sound engineers need an audio player that has a setting of quot;Play Oncequot; (or sometimes called quot;Play Pausequot; or whatever). For musicians, this feature is used to hit Play on a given quot;backing trackquot; and then the musician does NOT have to frantically hit Stop when the song finishes. Rather, when the song finishes, the play simply stops and waits for the musician to select another song and hit Play. For theatre engineers, its more for queuing up sound effects and when you play one, the player STOPS and waits for the theatre engineer to select another sound effect and hit Play. The concept is quite simple. When viewing a list of songs in Playlist mode or folder mode or whatever, when the musician hits Play, the player goes through the song and when it reaches the end, the player completely STOPS and is basically waiting for the user to do something (such as select another song, etc.). Creative Labs has had this feature on their .mp3 players for years. Musicians would love this feature, and, when combined with all the other wonderful things I have seen within Poweramp (replay gain, treblebass, EQ, etc.), I think youd have an instant hit with musicians who use quot;tracksquot; for live performance. Thanks for listening and I wish you the best in 2012#33; Sincerely, Kevin B.

I have a wish to the power am app it would be fine if I could see the cover besides the title, artist (id tag information) in the folder list and in a play list so in my opioion it is much easyer to find a song.

features to support listening to mp3 audiobooks....	My public library makes MP3 audiobooks available on CD-ROM, but my cars CD player doesnt read them. So instead, I port them over (temporarily, of course) to my Android phone, and use Poweramp to play them through my car stereo. Heres where the problems begin: 1) Poweramp insists on "temporarily" naming each track with the name of the book (the album), and I have to access the track number via the INFO button. Inconvenient at best, and dangerous to have to do all that while Im driving. To be clear, the information is still there, but Poweramp wants to display OTHER information to me. If it could display the TRACK NUMBER, both in the overall track listing as well as in the title window when the program runs full-screen, this would be a great help! 2) Now Im getting picky: I have a few books stored on my Android device, as well as many, many albums. I would love it if you would allow for "Bookmarks" to be created, so (lets say), Im 4-12 minutes in to track 65 on "Book XYZ," I could log a book-mark, then go to the gym and listen to music while I work out, and then go right back to the bookmark when Im back in my car driving home. Thanks. Excellent program. Very clear sound!! Steve S :ugeek:	bookmark,audiobooks,display,button

playlist position memory	I want the Poweramp app to remember the last song played when swapping between playlists. So when I switch to another playlist I want it to resume playback from the last played song and not start at song number 1 as it currently does. I basically want the same functionality the Adobe pdf reader app has when managing pdf documents. It keeps track of which page was the last read on each and every pdf and goes to that page whenever you open the pdf and not page 1. My playlists are getting long and it is a huge nuisance to have to listen to the first few songs when swapping between them. Moreover, one playlist may be the chapters of an audio book, then it makes even more sense to be sure to continue from where it was last time.	playlist,library,album,bluetooth

night modedimming mode	Essentially I use Poweramp as my Music Player when my phone is docked in my car. I absolutely LOVE the swiping feature when I want to change tracks while driving because it is eyes free. The issue I have with it is when I am night driving the background colors (behind the album art and the album art in some cases as well) specifically get pretty bright. What I would love is quick button or an option to turn on a quot;Night Modequot; which would dim the screen (Like both my GPS and my CarHome Ultra do). This will make it much less distracting while I am driving. Currently at night I am forced to use the shortcut buttons (this means no swiping) in my CarHome Ultra because it at least has a night mode and is much less distracting while driving. However this causes me to have to find the shortcut buttons and also doesnt give me quick sight to what song is playing (some songs start quiet and I have a pretty large Library on my phone).	playlist,button,album art,display

hide or fix layout in android notifications	On my Galaxy S3, Poweramp takes up two rows in the notifications. The left side of each row is all space, and the right side of the rows have track name and then transport controls. Thats a lot of wasted space, and I usually wouldnt want Poweramp taking up even one precious row in my notifications, let alone two. Worse, I operate my phone with my left hand so I cant reach the Poweramp controls with my left thumb. I request an option to cusotmize the layout of the notifications to save space and to put the controls with the reach of the left thumb. I also request an option to suppress Poweramp from the notifications completely.

couple of things to make poweramp the best music player#33;	So, I have a few suggestion for Poweramp 3.0. Firstly, the app needs to come together a bit better in terms of transitioning between folders, library and the player. Whenever I hand my phone to a friend they never have any idea how to get out of the music player (w. the album art etc.) and into my library to look through my songs or artists. And the back button just exits out of the app. The only two ways are pressing the music note button in the top (very faint, doesnt shout LIBRARY to me or anyone else I know or pressing the name of song (just below the big play button). Secondly, I experienced this bug running 4.1 and 4.2 on my Galaxy S II and 4.2 on my Nexus 4. When using the new holo fast scroll thing for artists or songs it jerks around randomly if I just scroll normally (slow-scroll). That definitely needs to be fixed. Also, a more unified lyricsalbum art feature would be really nice, like if you could record 10,000 songs and have your own database of lyrics and album artwork that is 100 and if someone requests it, it always suggests your perfect set of lyricsalbum artwork. Although, it should require high corelation between the titleartist before syncing. A nicer settings layout would be nice, maybe break it down into just 3-4 categories when you press settings. (not very important) Increased cmpatibility with winamp would be great too, or itunes but thats probably pretty hard given its apple. Another bug is that since I upgraded to my Nexus 4 (4.2) the swipingswitching between songs is very laggy, like ill swipe or press the next button several times before it actually does anything. Not laggy in terms of FPS; it just doesnt switch the song even though everything is still smooth. This might just be a jelly bean bug like the other one. Thanks#33;	widget,lockscreen,jeelybean,button

radio style crossfade	This idea is not my own, but I have heard hardly any comments on it when mentioned on earlier occations, so I thought it might be time to give it a thread of its own. The idea. Normal crossfade: track one is close to end and starts fading out while crossfadeing to track 2. Track 2 is starting on zero volume level and is fading in during crossfade. Radio crossfade: track one i close to end and starts fading out. Before track 1 is completely silent, track 2 starts playing at normal volume. The good thing is that you get a nice crossfade without missing the initial tones of every track. Happy for comments#33;	playlist,shuffle,crossfade,volume
disable crossfade by genre	First: I#8217;ve had an Android phone for a while, just bought a car stereo with built#8211;in Bluetooth audio streaming last week. I figured I#8217;d give the trial version of Poweramp a go because it keeps showing up as highly recommended in the Android Market. I bought the full version after about 10 minutes of trying it out #8212; the combination of Poweramp plus Bluetooth streaming is *too cool*. Plus I love all the extra features you wouldn#8217;t necessarily expect like crossfading, FLAC amp; ReplayGain support and album art downloading. I tend to just throw all my songs into one folder and listen to them on shuffle, crossfading from one to the other. I like just about every genre of music so the result is rather eclectic. Crossfading works really well for most of what I listen to (which is pretty #8220;beat heavy#8221;) but some genres don#8217;t hold up well to crossfading #8212; punk songs, for example, don#8217;t have much of a lead#8211;in or #8211;out and there#8217;s not a lot to fade from or to. So, my feature request would be to allow the ability the user to choose genres for which they#8217;d like to disable crossfading. Thanks, and keep up the great work#33;	playlist,bluetooth,album art,library
crossfade changeble	Hello#33; Ive just downloaded Poweramp few days ago, and was amused about its crossfade function, but i want to suggest a little bit feature request, that might be helpfull: let users change crossfade duration from 0 (not 1000ms) to end.(15000ms). And it wold be great if i can change it manually, by keyboard, not by slider (as now). I think, that its would be very helpfull for some users and me too#33; Thanks for great player and sorry for my English (im from Moscow, Russia).	playlist,shuffle,album art,crossfade
feature request: crossefade (fade out, not fade in)	Hi, LOVE the player! I really like the new crossfade feature, but I cant help thinking that if you make it optional for it to automatically does now (with the cut our of silence at the end of tracks) and then start the next song on top of the end of the previous one WITHOUT it fading in, it will give the radio-ish feel. I miss the beginning on every song the way it works now. Not cool. If you only fade out, and start the next song full blast over the ending, then it will sound much more right to the ears. Hope this is possible. I really appreciate the work youre doing, and it is great to see how thriving this forum is. Sincerely, Kingkeld.	playlist,crossfade,screen,control

space recognition in title tag	Hi there, Lovin the Poweramp#33;#33; Thanks for all the hard work on my favorite app#33; I have a huge classical music collection which I have organized such that I have 5 spaces at the beginning of many of the track (and file) titles (I literally press the spacebar 5 times before entering any characters).

changing tags on actual mp3 file	Few requests. 1) Some songs that I buy online have the wrong genre. For example, Christmas music listed as miscellaneous, or soundtrack, or pop. I found out I can modify the genre tag in power amp, which is fantastic. However, it doesnt change the genre tag in the actual file. Reason that I suspect this is that when I open the song in other music players (Google, Amazon, HTC), the original genre still shows up. Its there a way to add function of permanently changing the tags? 2) Can you add theme that has white text instead of neon#092;fluorescent? Thanks for this great program, that Im sure can only get better and of course sell more as it gets better.	tag,library,album art,artist
poweramp for windows 8 phone	Any chance of a Poweramp App for the Windows 8 Phone OS? Pleeeeeaaassse? Both media player solutions currently available(nokia music and xbox music) are rudimentary pieces of garbage that does everything on training wheels. It also leans way to heavily on cloud based solutions. I miss the control and slick UI of Poweramp on my old Android. Id definitely pay again for Poweramp Full if there was a Windows 8 Phone version.

This is the first portable music player I have every owned (yes, an old fogy loading his phone with classical music), and while I am enjoying the music, I am also puzzling away on how to use it. eg. Loading a playlist (it showed up but said not loaded when I imported via isyncr from sons itunes on pc). I have that working. Any of fancy settings allow me to compress dynamic range? (forever adjusting volume as music switches from solo instrumentvoice to full orchestra). Can I switch from playlist to playing a specific sound and then go back to the playlist in the same position? (I suspect this is something to do with queuing??) Any way to quot;shufflequot; but keep whole pieces together (ie dont regard a symphony movement as a separate song). At the moment, the only I can find to do that is use an audio editor on the pc to collect the whole piece into a single quot;songquot; and import that. etc. Took a while to discover the hold-down function on shuffle.

vst wrapper: maybe a pipe dream, but i#39;d pay extra for it.	Besides a couple minor quirks with the way Poweramp handles metadata, theres only one thing that I really would like to see change in Poweramp: the inclusion of a VST wrapper. As a Foobar2000 user, theres a number of VST plugins that are nice to have, but one that is essential. Terry Wests ReLife does the seemingly impossible job of automatically repairing a lot of the damage done through heavily-compressed masters. It does a better job of analyzing and simulating the original waveform than anything Ive ever used including dedicated programs like DeClipper. The best part is that it does so without needing to re-encode the file or micromanage the process per song and its completely free. The ability to load VST plugins into Poweramp would be a dream come true. I know making a VST wrapper would not be a quick and easy thing. But if you somehow found the time to make one, Id happily pay a premium, even more than the cost of the app itself, to add it in Poweramp. Theres no music player on Android or iOS that can do anything remotely like what ReLife does and the difference is simply stunning.	version,search,album art,display

But this is just the way I feel and it should not infringe upon other users who may use the quot;advance listquot;. So it would be nice if we could customize what we want to show for Repeat and Shuffle but always have the same method (option) of reseting these back to their defaults. Same should exist for Shuffle too. A good place to add this requested feature would be within the transparent Menu that shows when we long-press on Repeat button or long-press on Shuffle button	repeat,segment a-b,shuffle,queue

poll let#39;s have a file browser in poweramp	Hi I would like to propose having a File Browser in Poweramp. It would work similar to the way an Android file manager works in that it can browser the systemsd card for folders and files but instead within Poweramp it would be filtered only be able see all supported audiovideo file extensions for immediate on-the-fly playback within Poweramp. Rationale for this proposal: 1.) Ready to use on-the-fly playback 2.) Not all users use or have familarty with creating playlists 3.) Avoid having to use a 3rd party file manager.(potentially triggering Poweramp app crashes) 4.) Able to more accurately locate and playback files from inconsistent locations such as USB connected drives (especially with USB OTG support on devices like Samsung Galaxy S3, tablets etc).5.) Easily access and playback files from Folders of music which have not been user added to the Poweramp Library. 6.) There are a few reasons why a user may not want to add (scan) a particular folder of music to Poweramps Library. One of which might be content. 7.) This would help complete Poweramp as an all round super music player. Poweramp already has support or planned support for ad-hoc things such as Lyrics, podcast streaming, online radio, cloud, ratings, tag editing..The list goes on. All of which are preliminary supported or schedules to get future support in Poweramp. An internal basic File Browser for Poweramp would really add benefit. It would display only Filenames and no tag data or anything else, strictly filenames only, similar to the Poweramp All Songs view: Such a Browser if implemented, should be accessible from both within the Poweramps quot;Libraryquot; selection view and also available as an optional quot;Startup screenquot;. Maybe some basic file management actions such as Rename, Batch Rename, Delete, Copy, Move, Share etc could be considered although these are not important. If not considered then this Poweramp quot;Browserquot; would be a strictly read-only explorer.

There should be a poll on how many people use the stereo-x feature, since I persoanlly find it useless compared to a good virtualizer. I have to use third party virtualizers for the desired effect, and thus, I need to untick quot;direct volume controlquot; in Poweramp options for the external virtualizer to work properly, making music sound much worse.

three suggestions	When playing a song the android quot;backquot; button should go to a list just like clicking on the song title goes to the list. (It currently goes to the Android desktop, which doesnt seem consistent with how the back button behaves elsewhere). While clicking on the song title (in the single song display with album art) returns to the list, there seems no obvious way to get from the list back to the single song, short of pressing the quot;backquot; button at least 4 times. In this connection, in the single song display the song title and progress bar have two separate clickable areas, song title and progress bar. In the list display, there is also a song title and a progress bar that look very similar, but they behave differently: they are not two clickable areas but one, and they do something different (just clicking once causes the song to restart). I suggest that these be made consistentboth on the single song and in the list there should be a separate clickable area for the song title and progress bar. (I would also like to see clicking on the song title return you to the single song display, but I understand some people might actually want it to restart the track instead. Maybe an option to choose one behavior?) I can play all songs by an artist by long-clicking on the artist. However if I do this 1) The songs are not in any reasonable order. For instance, they are not alphabetical by song, and they are not alphabetical by album. I suggest making them alphabetical by song. 2) When it finishes playing the last track it says quot;list finishedquot;. I suggest that the quot;next trackquot; button should also say quot;list finishedquot; rather than taking me to a song by a different artist (Im not sure if this is a feature request or just a bug). Google Play tells me the app is not compatible with my tablet. I suspect that among other reasons this is because the app requires Bluetooth and my tablet doesnt have Bluetooth. I suggest not making Bluetooth a mandatory requirement to download the app. I know I can still get it from your page but this is annoying.	equalizer,all,repeat option,last played
album art swipe gesture is too sensitive (v2.07 build 515)	Hello Max and all the forum, Currently when (most times) when I single tap on the Album Art area to toggle the showing of the EQVolume that displays over album art OFTEN this single-tap would result in a swipe to the next or previous track. I adore and use both Swipe album art to next track and Single tap on album art to show EQVol.... ....However these two related touch gestures must not interfere with each other. I just hope that the Swipe album art could be made to be a little less sensitive or perhaps a sensitivty option in the user Settings to control this. Thanks for reading.

Id like to be able to easily launch a floating Poweramp widget over my navigation app so that I can see the track being played and also to switch between tracks without having to move away from the GPS application running behind it.

jump to letter	I love Poweramp, but the one area its lacking in is quickly jumping to the part of a list that you want. For example, UberMusic has this feature: Above every new letter in any list (songs, artist, genres, etc.) there is a box containing the letter. You can see it on the left side of the picture that Ive uploaded. Whenever you click this box, it brings up this menu which allows you to jump to any letter. Its a great feature and it actually had me using UberMusic over Poweramp for almost a year, even though UberMusic is no longer updated and Poweramp has infinitely more features. This one feature is just that good. No more scrolling forever, missing your letter, and having to go back. Where this feature really shines though is when youre driving. I dont think it really matters so much HOW you bring up this menu, but it should be accessible easily from anywhere in any list. If you support this, please drop a message here just so it gets noticed. Thanks#33;	album,artist,list,playlist
play a folder	Hi, Ive just started trialling Poweramp. Is it possible to play all files in a folder (in album track order) without adding the folder to the library first? I have a few folders containing foreign language lessons that Id like to listen to and I dont want to find them among the albums in my music library. Im imagining an interface such as long-touching a folder in explorer and there would be a quot;Play all tracks in Powerampquot; option. This option would only exist if the folder contained audio tracks. Another option would be starting Poweramp and choosing a quot;play a specific folder ad-hocquot; menu entry. If not possible, and if I have to add the folders to the library first, then is it possible to exclude specific genres from the library display? (So I can list all kinds of music genres but not spoken wordeducational) Thanks	folder,playlist,library,artist
remember place in playlists	I tend to create a shuffled playlist of my whole music library and listen to it all over a period of several months. Occassionally during that time I will want to play something outside of the playlist though, and in order to go back to where I was in the playlist I lave to remember which song I was on (eg 6222591 currently) and navigate there manually. Would be really nice if it could remember my last place in ALL playlists, not just the current one. Eg I am listening to an Audiobook (Iain M Banks Surface Detail, excellent in case anyone is interested) but I sometimes want to listen to music at other times from my playlist. I currently use the default music app for the audiobook and Poweramp for the music so that I dont lose my place in either. Otherwise its a bit like trying to read two books at the same time with only one bookmark...	playlist,folder,library,bookmark
lockscreen landscape option	Hi#33; My Name is Douglas. Ive been using Poweramp at least 6 months, in my opinion is the best music player for Android, full of options and also adding new ones according with the availability and common sense, and its just because of this that I#8217;m writing. I was wondering if it#8217;s possible to add a function to the Poweramp lock screen. I have a Motorola Defy, there#8217;s a cardock function in this mobile phone, when you put it in the dock the screen orientation is changed according with the mobile phone position, so when you activate the lock screen function in the Poweramp it only have portrait orientation. However the dock orientation can be both, portrait and landscape, in this case it would be awesome if the lock screen change the orientation for both as the regular GUI does.	screen,lock,orientation,rotate

beat matching and notfication bar requests	Hi, one of the main reasons I bought Poweramp was because of the crossfading feature. However some songs sound awful when theyre mixed together like this. so it would be awesome if you could add beat matching on the crossfade feature, a lot of dj programs and music players have this option. I would be more then willing to pay again for this feature#33; An other issue I have with the player is the control buttons in the notifcation bar. Theyre really crammed in together, and often Ill hit the wrong button (press skip track instead of pause, which is really irriating when listening to podcasts) I googled this a while back and read how you implimented the x close icon to allow the it to stay pinned there after the music has been paused. I think it would be better if you implimented the swipe to clear feature on ICS+ devices that closes the app by swiping to either side. This three remaining buttons could then be spaced out better. or if not this, at least give some options to customise this, choose which buttons to have etc. thanks	playlist,button,volume,tag

use wma star ratings	With Windows Media Player you have the option to embed the ratings for WMA files in the files themselves. Checkbox quot;Maintain my star ratings as global ratings in filesquot;. That they are stored, I know for a fact, because when I transfer files from one computer to another, they have the same rating on the destination computer and appear in the same auto rating playlists. It would be nice if Poweramp had the option to read these ratings and use them, so I wouldnt have to rate or re-rate them when I sync thousands of files. I used Windows Media ASF View 9 and found that they are stored in the Extended Content Description Object (1194 bytes) with an Attribute name WMSharedUserRating (UTF-8). The index is not fixed because when I changed a file from 5 stars to 3 stars, the offset into the file changed. And the values seemed strange - 99 for 5 stars and 50 for 3 stars but as a DWord, they make sense as a relative value. So here are the decimal values I found 1 star - 1 2 star - 25 3 star - 50 4 star - 75 5 star - 99 I know that finding these values would require knowledge of the structure of offsets and pointers in that file and I seem to remember seeing something like that once, and maybe the Windows Media API might be useful, but even if that is not available a straight search for the UTF-8 string ought to work. However, even if you never get around to an enhancement like this, I still am more than pleased with my purchase.	option,shuffle,rating,ratings

option to disable some functions	There#180;s a number of functions in Poweramp that I, at least, would like to be able to permanently disable (via an option in the settings), because I never use any of them. That is, I never use any of them on purpose, but sometimes they#180;re triggered by accidental touches either by my fingers, or by the headphone cord - MOSTLY by the headphone cord, that always seems to fall on the worst places possible. So, please add a way to permanently disable, or to lock the state of these options: - RepeatAdvance List, etc - I always use Advance List; - Shuffle - I never turn it on - on purpose, that is; - Next folderlast folder navigation buttons - again, I never used these two on purpose. For context: I always play my music following folder navigation, filename sorting, etc, which is why accidentally turning on any of these options is so annoying. And I have a lot of collections with 50+ files on the same folder, making it a pain to search again for what I was listening... Thanks.	folder,library,button,sort

please improve the #34;first symbol#34; navigation through lists	Hello#33; Not sure if I used the right name for this - I speak about quick browsing through albumartistsongetc lists by sliding finger in the right side of the lists - it allows to browse by first symbol of list items. I think the distribution of first symbols through display height is too straightforward - it supposes that I have items starting with every symbol and I have same amount of items for each symbol. So in this navigation A got first 128 of screen height, B second 128 and so on. But if for example, my list consists of one A item and 100 items from N to Z - first half of navigation height belong to A (only for the single item), and second half to N to Z. It would be so much better if in this case the height would be distributed not between all 28 letters, but only between actually existing 14. Another example is when I got one item starting with 1 and all others are distributed through the alphabet. Even in this case we got first 13 of screen to 1 with space wasted to rest non-existing numbers. The more smarter way is of course 129 for each symbol. Can you do this please? Many thanks#33;	album art,theme,design,playlist
completely turn off the app	Can you please add in this feature? I understand why you want the app to run in the background, but its unintuitive to not offer a full restart option somewhere. Like ANY app, there will be bugs, and many of these bugs can be solved by simply restarting the given app. However with Poweramp you need to shut off your phone for the app to restart.

compliments, questions and requests	Dear people who made Poweramp possible, I absolutely love Poweramp. Ive tried a lot of mp3 players on my Galaxy S, but this is the best. It also makes my iPod completely obsolete, cause you cannot change a lot in the preamp of an iPod. I do have some questions requests for the makers: 1 Poweramp takes a very long time to startup on my Samsung Galaxy S. Sometimes even up to 15 minutes. I know that a Galaxy S is not the newest of smartphones, but still.... 15 minutes to startup and it sometimes uses up to 85 of my CPU. Is there a way to make everything faster? 2 It is very hard (maybe impossible) to change the name of an artist, album or the genre of an album or artist. As far as I can tell you have to change it in every individual song (which can take really long). Why not make it possible to change the name of an artist or album without having to change it in individual songs? 3 I dont know how to add album art for a whole album when Poweramp doesnt recognize the album. I have always the year in front of the name of the album in stead of just the name (so for example: 2001 Is This It (from The Strokes) in stead of just Is This It). Result is that Poweramp cannot add album art because it doesnt recognize the title. Maybe it is possible, but I dont know how. Can somebody explain me how to do that? Otherwise its probably good to fix that. 4 I like the mono button. But there is a whole spectrum between complete mono and stereo. I would love to see the mono button getting replaced by a slider, that makes it possible to between stereo and mono, to explore everything in between. 5 I would love to see a button getting added that swaps channels. So make the music from the left ear come out of the right ear and vica versa. Hopefully you can help me#33; Cheers, Guoy	album art,playlist,option,tag

back button should return you to the album list	... if you started playback of an entire album by playing it from the album list. I find an album I want to listen to, I hold and select PLAY. When I want to find another album, Ill press the track name (just below the album art) and it send me to the track list. And then I have to push the back button. This is not very intuitive. So instead, youre forcing me to first press the MENU button, and then I have to select quot;FoldersLibquot;. I really feel that this should be acessible directly from the now playing screen... by a single-click button. Any chance of fixing this? Or at least letting us choose what should happen when we push the track name. Or even letting the BACK button on my phone send me back to the previous screen (Album list).	button,screen,library,view
random album button	My Creative Zen mp3-player has the possibility to map various functions to one of its buttons. Ive mapped quot;Album of the dayquot; to this button.

automatic gain control	AGC (automatic gain control) is a method used to avoid volume fluctuations between tracks. We all have songs that sound too loud, or too soft, but with automatic gain control, all songs could sound at the same volume. It is not like compression, since it scans the input gain in the file, and then adjusts the output gain to match the required preferences. What compression does is to try to mantain the song in certain db level at all times, which causes some minor problems with songs with both soft and loud parts. I saw the other thread about compression, and also saw how admins refused to implement compression due to some problems, including the one I mentioned. So, this is what I say. Implement AGC in Poweramp. Theres another music player in the android market which does have this feature already (as seen in this screenshot), but Poweramp is way too cool compared to that music player (which also has virtualization, unlike Poweramp). I say this because Ive tested it myself, and with AGC, I never had to worry about adjusting volume for one song and adjusting it again for another song ever ever again. Thanks in advance.	volume,screen,play,sound check
decoding speed test to find most battery-efficient audio format	If there was a way to measure how fast the player can decode selected audio file, users could make more informed decision on which audio format to use with their devices.

Id love to choose my audio format and settings with knowledge about its effect on battery life.	codec,audio file,m4c,screen
two requests for effective playlist management	Hello all, I have the following two (rather simple) requests which will allow me to use Poweramp as full-scale Tango DJ (***) app. 1. When adding a track to an already long 50+ list, it is real pain to first add the track and then slide it all the way up to the beginning of the list. It wouldve been of immence help to me to have a new button, quot;add to beggining of playlistquot; 2. When you are playing your queue through PA, and at the same time adding new songs, it is quite easy to accidentally switch the track by pressing on it.... and your cozy evening suddenly gets ruined. It wouldve been great if there was a configuration that allows to disable staring new tracks by simple pressing. E.g. an explicit quot;right menuquot; -gt; quot;Startquot;, would be the only possibility to swich the track. (*** Tango DJ-ing is quite different from traditional Disco in that we do not beat-match or mix tracks, but rather chose on a fly a set of four tracks of the same orquesta based on the whole number of subjective criterias from the library of maybe 500-1000 tracks or more, then go to the next set... and so on... This requires quite an effective playlist management app, which Poweramp definitely is, but without the feature No 2 it is way too dangerous to use in real-life DJ-ing even as a backup to the laptop) Thank you very much, IS	playlist,play,button,search

album art image downsizing method	Good afternoon, could please consider looking into changing the interpolation method the player uses to scale down high resolution album art images ? Majority of my music library has album arts in about 1200x1200 and on my GSIII, the downsized images look fuzzy, almost like it was downsized using nearest neighbor method.

I know there is a way to select all songs, but you have to select a song to play, then hold down the song name, then click on artist. This seems to be a fairly complicated, roundabout way.	playlist,artist,library,album
skins development suggestion: use zip not apk	I think an ordinary ZIP compression archive method would be the convenient method for skintheme creators to have. Just like in the Java ME (J2ME) app called KD Player (also Russian)... A typical skin encompassed two files: A.) a .KDI file (a renamed .PNG or .JPG file) - this file included all the skins image contents B.) a .KDS file (a renamed .TXT file) - a text formatted file which held all the coordinates to a skin e.g. which button is positioned where etc On the other hand, for For Poweramp, Id recognize that an equivalent kdi method would not be as in image file but rather as a ZIP file with all the individual image elements inside. Perhaps two separate kdi equivalents each for portrait and landscape view of the same skin. Here is a screenshot from my text editor of a typical KD Player .kds text based file (further coordinates not in the screenshot of course do exist specified for things such as Play button, rewind button etc etc)... Here is a screenshot of a .kdi (renamed to its true file-extension of a PNG - it includes rgb alpha transparency)... Screenshot of resulting skin (from both the same kdi and kds posted above): btw, this KD Player skin used in this example is called quot;Cletic FCquot; and is available here: http:www.easter-eg...insPage11.php So KD Player loads the skin theme by just reading the contents of the kds and then applying the kdi both of which have to be in the same folder. Furthermore each KD Player skin (although not necessary) has a waiting screensplash screen that the skin maker includes and whenever KD Player loads new skin, this screen is briefly shown before taking the user to an Information which gives detailing on the skin author, date of creation, copyright etc which is something to think about as a cool feature when initiating skintheme support in any media player app. I hope Max, Poweramps developer, could CONSIDER implementing an ALTERNATIVE more easier skinning dev style like this as an alternative to the Android SDK XML based method that is already planned for Poweramp. Well, thanks for reading	skin,widgets,tablet,equalizer
excluding songs from shuffle	I Googled this feature before and it seems it has been discussed here, so Im basically posting to show there is interest in this feature and any news on it. Basically songsalbumsfolders would have an option to exclude when in shuffle mode. When I myself have shuffle on, Im looking for my more popular or upbeat songs. By no means do I want to just carry those songs though. When I want to listen to that album I want all the songs. Also goes the same for albums I just dont want to hear during shuffle...those albums I have to be in a dedicated mood for. iTunes had this feature for the iPod.

track songs skipping to identify songs least needed for a user	Its a common practice to download whole albums to a phone and add all songs to a play list.However its usual thing that you dont like all songs on an album.But manual removal of such songs can be a time consuming task.And also you dont know from the very beginning that I wont like a song after you listen to it few more times.Therefore you leave all songs.But then, when you listen to a song and dont like it, you usually skip it.Therefore if you track such skip cases for a while you can identify what songs are candidates to be least liked for the user.Once you identify those, you can present those in a separate list and provide user with multi-selection of those and a couple of options (called e.g.):Hide - exclude from playing in all play listsDelete - physically remove song from a storage (its good to save storage space)Clear skip history - can be useful While I dont pursue any specific implementation of the identification algorithm I would like to provide a sample algorithm description.ff (favoriteness factor) = ((number of skips * average listen time prior to skip in seconds) + (number of full listens * 120 seconds)) total number of listens Lets say theres a song which you dont like much in an album.Youve listened to it 5 times and skipped it 4 times after 10 seconds on average.If you listen to song for complete duration it accounts as 120 seconds.Then it gives us ff = (4*10 + 120)5 = 32 seconds.For songs which havent been skipped theres no need to calculate the favoriteness factor.Then the songs can be sorted ascending by favoriteness factor to present the least liked songs first.	playlist,library,album art,tag

previous album next album with the headphones control	Hi first, i wanna say thank you to Max, because this is the best music player by far. It was my first paid app and really, the one that i most use. Well, about the request : its amazing how confortable now is to be able to press 2 clicks and go next song and 3 clicks and go to the previous one... i absolutely love that feature #33; I have a Galaxy S3.. and i was wondering if theres any way if you could implement a similar function, but with the folder album. I normally copy the artist folder, and then, subfolders with the albums example : Nirvana #092; 1991 - Nevermind #092; 1993 - In Utero #092; 1994 - Unplugged in New York. And I would die to be able to skip to the next album with a press with the headphone control, example, 1 long press skips to the next album, 2 long presses go to the previous one... just think about how confortable would be whats your opinion? thx and greetings from Argentina.	artist,album,folder,sort
compressor	First off this is a great App. I purchased it and use it everyday. It has many great features including headphone detection and delete.

android media box with external hard drive	I have an android media box plugged into my tv. I would like to use it as my music player and keep my music on an external hard drive connected with USB. Is there any way to get Poweramp to look on my external drive (not an sdcard) for my music?	library,flash drive,button,bluetooth
counter?	hi, here to ask for a feature. could you implement some sort of counter that counts the total time Poweramp played? like in foobar. just total play time, and a reset button. id does not have to be in the main window, somewhere in settings. it would be nice when trying to determine battery life. also, a small thing i consider a bug. in the playlist, if you hold a finger on a song, the menu pops up (the one with enque, delete, etc...). in my opinion it pops up too easily. 3 out of 5 times i want to select a song i end up opening that menu. could you make so that you need to hold your finger on a song name a little bit longer before the menu pops up? Thnaks!	playlist,button,option,play

android.intent.action.musicplayer	Poweramp doesnt seem to respond to android.intent.action.MUSICPLAYER (as described here http:stackoverflow...ing-an-mp3-file) The main reason I need this is because my dock application uses this intent to launch music player, currently I get the Android Music Player amp; DoubleTwist as options but not Poweramp.

It would be nice to have an option to do NOT put notification on top, or ablity to set notification priority manualy (like in this app).	button,notification,playlist,widget
analog volume knob	I find I like using the analog volume knob in the tonevolume menu because the hardware buttons on my RAZR MAXX are stepped too far apart to adjust the volume precisely to my liking much of the time. However, I believe the analog volume knob in Poweramp could use some improving (at least on the RAZR MAXX) as its not consistent and reliable all the time and as precise as a true analog knob should be. Of course, this could be related only to Poweramp within the RAZR MAXX but if possible to address it that would be much appreciated. I also wouldnt mind an option to have the the analog volume knob able to be placed on the playing screen rather than drilling down into a menu to use it, although I understand this may be tricky for aesthetic reasons. Thanks.	volume,option,button,screen
remote directories	Is there a way to play remote files? I cannot find a way to get Poweramp app to quot;seequot; remote directories. i.e. directories mounted using SSHFSAndroid app. This works using MixZing player app. However, MixZing will not play flac files. Poweramp does. If this cant be done now, I request that this feature be added.	bluetooth,version,playlist,button

queue progression - repeat mode	This stems from this post: http:forum.poweram...een-yes-or-not Basically if you, like me, play your entire music library but like to select a particular set of songs to play now and again but then return to the normal quot;all playquot; list the current looping system is annoying. Because I want my entire music to loop through indefinatly I use the quot;Repeat Listquot; option, but as soon as you play a queue of songs that starts to loop the queue and never exits the queue if your using the specific queue exit option outlined in the linked post. The only way to exit the queue is to have it on any other repeat option, but then it wont loop the main list once its exited the queue. So I think something like another repeat mode like: Loop but advance queues. It probably sounds more complicated than it is, but if you read the linked post and replicate it its quite obvious.	repeat,cycle,queue,playlist
two queue options - perminant and a temporary queue	At the moment the queue option keeps the tracks in it even when they have finished playing. Could we have an alternative that you queue up the tracks, they play and as they finished they are removed out of the queue. Basically work like Winamps quot;Enqueuequot; feature does, but I like the idea of having a persistant queue as well.	playlist,queue,play,reset

volume fade when sleep timer set	It would be nice to have the option to select in a tickbox below the minutes slider, in sleep timer menu, to make the volume fade as the time goes to expire... Since some of us use it during sleep and set the timer so that it closes and not wake up, it would be more natural and more quot;sleeping friendlyquot; the volume decreases in a rate (exponential, linear or whatever) (example 1). If you are still awake and feel the volume too low then by pressing the up-volume button you can bring it back to normal and may start the decrease again (example 2). What do you thing?	button,setting,sleep timer,volume
listening to podcasts	Im sure that most people use Poweramp to listen to music. However, I suspect there are many others like me who use it to listen to podcast files. Every week I download around 20 files of programs from the BBC and NPR, so that I can listen to these while out walking. I want to listen to them in the order that they were broadcast, so I prepend the broadcast date to the file name, and then upload them all to one folder for replay. While this is possible with Poweramp, it is by no means ideal. While I did find it possible (with difficulty) to get the folder to display and play the files in filename order, I have found no way to get the status to show the file name, rather than the tags, which in general I do not want to see. I wonder if it would be possible to provide a set of podcast-friendly settings to assist folk like me? Chris	tag,folder,playlist,library
1: shuffle icon at the top of library lists. 2: move find outside of lists.	First off, thanks to the developers for what is hands down the best sounding mobile device audio player app#33; Heres what I love about it: The ten band equalizer is simply mind-blowing#33; The ability to save equalizer presets is awesome#33; I already have a preset for headphones and another for when the device is plugged into a stereo. Honestly, this is a feature that Ive been wanting in a player for a LONG time. I also love that it saves your place when you unplug from the jack and automatically resumes when you plug back into it. Heres what would make it (to me anyway) the best audio app on the planet. Ever: #1: Place a shuffle icon at the top of all library lists. Heres how a user has to shuffle all songs using the current library UI: go into library; go into All Songs; pick a song; click the suffle icon on the player interface; click the next button to make it actually randomly choose a song. Heres how it should work: go into library; click shuffle icon beside All Songs. OR: go into library: go into quot;All songs;quot; click shuffle icon (should be the first item in any list really). Your way: 5 clicks. My way: 1 or 2 clicks. Reducing those unnecessary clicks is a major reason why iTunes is so popular. Im not saying copy iTunes. I dont want you to get sued. Im saying if your competition has a smart, non-proprietary feature thank them for doing the market research for you and use it. Besides, having the shuffle being the first list item is a feature of all of your serious android competitors as well (doubleTwist has it, proplayer has it). Theres a reason for that. Its a nice little convenient feature that people use. #2: Move the quot;Findquot; feature outside of the list. Heres why. Say you start scrolling down the list of all songs, and say you have about a thousand on your device. About 7 scroll swipes later, you say to yourself, quot;You know what. Using Find would probably be faster.quot; Now you have to scroll all the way back to the top of the list. That shouldnt be necessary. You should be able to just tap quot;findquot; from any point in any list screen.	equalizer,all,repeat option,last played
a pack of ideias [updated with pictures#33;#33;]	My first post was a bit confusing so I decided to make it simple and give you some visual support for my ideas. Well, to make long story short, I recently switched to Android from an iPhone 3 GS and one of the main reasons was the fact that I found a good iPodiPhone player replacement: Poweramp. By now, Im already a huge Poweramp fan: its as visually simple as the iPhone music player (I actually like Poweramp better) but brings some serious power. However, there are some features I believe would make it even better. Heres my take: 1. Full Library Mode Library view works flawlessly and I believe many of you, like me, spend most of the time in this view. So it would be really nice to have customizable items (e.g. all songs, albums, artists, playlists, queue, etc) on the lower menu according to your personal preferences. This would also obliterate the need for the back button on the top right corner. Instead, the Filter button could be visible all the time which is handy because one wouldnt have to scroll all the way to the top#33; NOTE: the full library mode could probably be activated in the advanced settings. 2. Double tap on artwork for album songs Simple and fast. Lets see: 3. Improved Widgets Love widgets? Me too So how could the Poweramp widget be improved? Have a look: NOTE: Double tap artwork for the songs. 4. Smart Title If you listen to classical music as I do, it is very common to come across the frustrating task of navigating through album tracks: some are gigantic and identical. To make it easier, one could just swipe to scroll the text: NOTE: the blue boxes are indications only [hidden]#33; The idea is to swipe over the title to have it scrolled (Oh and I was lazy to copy the full library mode layout I suggested ) 5. Instant quot;Now Playingquot; If you like gestures like I do, then youd like quot;pinch to Now Playingquot;. Fast access from any location: Some of my other wishes: Cover flow in landscape mode#33; Itunes integration (syncing directly through Poweramp - Id pay for that ) On a final note, please keep in mind these are my quot;renderingsquot;. No copyright infringement intended So if youve made it through all the post and like my ideas, let me know (and please excuse my english)#33;	equalizer,all,repeat option,last played
different albums with same title	Currently, Poweramp merges albums with same title into one. This can be pretty annoying if you have, say, six albums titled Die Kunst der Fuge. It would be great if Poweramp could separate albums correctly, according to the performers. Of course, it also happens that different tracks in one album are by different artists. But it is easy to distinguish between these two cases by looking at the track numbers for different artists: they are consecutive, starting with 1, in the first case, and complementary in the second case.	artist,playlist,sort,album
equalize settings by folder or album	I think it would be cool if you could save the EQ settings by folder or album. Some of my albums I like to listen with more bass, others not so much and Im usually shifting manually when necessary. The application could save automatically or an option to manually save to that folder album. Thank you.	folder,playlist,album art,album

The problem is that there are too many songs (hundreds go ) and Poweramp scan them to add them to the library #33;#33; So its unusable I dont use the library system, and use only folder listing feature....

exclude song or album from shuffle-all, remove song without delete from sd	Is it possible to implement a feature by which the user could designate an album or song to NOT be included in the shuffle-all mode? I have a few polkas, holiday music, instrumentals that I dont want to hear regularly and they keep popping up when shuffling all (I know, I can skip it, but that is inconvenient when driving or cutting grass). Also, in that same vein, it would be nice to be able to remove a song from the PA library WITHOUT deleting it from the SD card. Please share your thoughts.	playlist,library,option,album art
selecting from search items results in playback mode changing	Not sure if this is a bug, an undocumented feature or a feature request. I always use Poweramp in Folders mode, but when I search for something and then select to play a title from the search results, Poweramp switches my playback mode to Songs. I think it should stay in the users chosen mode. Actually, when that happens and I get stuck in Song or Album mode, how DO I change back to Folders mode without causing the currently-playing song to be stopped? Andre	search,display,playlist,button

anti headphone rumble feature	I think Neutron has a feature like this, but I was thinking that if you were to delete all frequencies below 20hz it would negate the rumble in most standard over-the-ear headphones when you crank the bass up real high, thus giving off a very clean deep bass, since our ears cant even hear frequencies at that level, it wouldnt degrade the sound quality	option,equalizer,playlist,version

play just one song, then stop	If I tap on a song in a folder, Poweramp plays that song, then it continues on to play another song. And then another, etc. My request is that if I tap on a particular song file in folder view (or if I send it a song to play, via file association, from a file browser app), that Poweramp play just that song, and then stop. Dont play any more files. I can understand that many wont want this behavior, But at least, please make it an option.	playlist,folder,play,queue
move song to different or new folder	please please add ability to add now playing song to a new folder or existing folder the same way adding to a playlist works.

library now playing buttons in player ui	For new users to Poweramp, it might take them a while to figure out how to get back to the library or the list of songs that is currently playing. When I let other people borrow my phone to use the music player, they can never figure it out since it is so unintuitive. It requires that you either press the song name in the player UI, or press the menu button gt; folderlibrary. It would make the experience much better if there were two buttons on the top of the Player UI screen: one leading back to the main folderlibrary screen, and another leading back to the specific list of songs currently playing.	button,library,screen,folder

D D1 A11.mp3 D2 B11.mp3 D3 C11.mp3 In the current implementation, only D1, D2, D3 are displayed as they have song inside. But will that be possible that quot;Dquot; can also be selected and all song (A11, B11, C11) will be added to the playlist? Thanks	playlist,folder,library,option
play mode in playlists	I think there needs to be an option to select a play mode for each playlist. For instance one playlist would be played shuffled while another playlist would play in sequence. The reason for this is I would like some of my mixes to play in random order while others (i.e. Pink Floyd - The Wall) really needs to be played in sequence.	playlist,folder,widget,option

edit album-wide tags	What would be nice is, if Im looking at the albums themselves, long-pressing on the album will bring up a context menu where I could edit the genre of the entire album. Right now, it appears the only way to do this is to go into the album, and set the genre of each individual song in the album. If there is a way to do this in the current version (2.5.0-build 488), I would appreciate tips on how to do this. Otherwise, this would be a nice feature to have as Ive noticed that some of the albums Ive synched over to my phone have incorrect genres and I dont feel like selecting each track to switch it over. Otherwise, Ive been a registered user of this app for almost two years and its still the ONLY music app I use on my droid phone. Awesome#33;	playlist,album,tag,library
album art?	When you long press on the art to choose an alternate, you are given choices, though I am unsure of the algorithm with which the program uses to provide these choices. It would be pretty awesome to be given an option to expand to a Google image search for the search string of the users choice or at least to default to the search string of the artist name. Then obviously to be able to assign an image of choice to the song or whatever. Sometimes, especially with singles or something, it is nice just to have a picture of the artist, as there is not always a corresponding quot;albumquot;, per se.	album art,search,lyrics,notification
avrcp 1.31.4	Ill just get this out of the way now: Fantastic app. Love just about everything about it. How about we pour some gravy on top. Adding AVRCP 1.3 or 1.4 support. It kills me that, had I an iPhone, I could see all my track metadata on my car receiver. But not with my Android phone. Being able to see the metadata while Im driving without having to manipulate my phone would make it much safer too. Yea, thats it! Think of it as a safety feature.

album listing: add index number in front of track title	Hi, Using Poweramp 2.06.508 on Galaxy Nexus, Standard Goggle Rom JB 4.11 Question: is it possible to prefix each track title with the ordinal index position? For example, the 25th track in the album will be displayed as quot;25. My Cool TrackNamequot; Speaking of album listing, I would like to know if the following behavior is intentional. Currently the album listing display each track as a two lines info: Line1: Track Title - DurationLine2: Artist - Album Name When reviewing the content of the album, the name of the album is permanently displayed on the top of the screen. It is rather redundant to repeat the album name at every track. May be this layout is designed for other type of listing playlist where Album info is useful. But for an album listing, this info is rather redundant.	album,display,album art,screen

2 new requests	Hi there, Nice program lots of useful features, thanks for your work, filtering algorythmes are a bit weak but they kinda work okay. Look up for the korg algos they work a treat. Anyway my request is today about a possibility of getting a memorize function on the eqs and stuff, Im using Poweramp in my car over long distances and love that shuffle button. The main problem is I have to ride the eq all the time as most songs has a very differant sound and volume level. Can you make every tweek page with a save button that prompts you to apply to all songs in directory? Also a volume boost fader would be most welcome too as a lot of mp3s are poorly mastered therefore lots of headroom to play with. And even better, a compressorexpander that keeps thee volumes equal would be ideal. However a manual boost button that operates on the full range on top would be excellent. Another thing can you make Poweramp to autoduck the sound when another app sends a notification, or the navigation voice instead of just being mixed in, it would be so good.. There you go, hope this helps. Vz	button,playlist,volume,screen
mka support (matroska audio)	Hi,What does quot;embed and standalone .cue files supportquot; mean if MKA (http:en.wikipedia.orgwikiMatroska) is not supported? If people were exposed to the amazing functionality of MKA, more people would use it. MKV video format is taking the web by storm because of the ability to store the chapter information in the single file.. The same goes for audio.Splitting a continuous audio stream album like a TranceDance compilation to X264MP3 as single compressed tracks leaves gaps. NO player plays single compressed tracks seamlessly. Im an audiophileproducer and if i hear a click or slight hang-up between tracks, I want to crap myself there and then...Ripping a complete album to one file and having a cue sheet inside the container to quot;skipquot; between tracks is just logical and it worked PERFECTLY on CorePlayer for Symbian (pity they dont develop for android)...I ask with tears in my eyes - could we PLEASE get MKA support. If not, what other way can I have a single audio file with CUE file to play my music...Regards,Barend	tag,embedded,cuesheet,version

Great program and I would like to use this on mytouch 4G also but I cant get over this feature. I make new music playlist files every week and it just all blends together without album art. On the mytouch 4g the HTC player has it set up so when you scroll the playlists the album art is right next to each song just like if you were searching under artists or albums.

various artists in library-#62;artist	Hi, let me first explain, what problem there is to fix: my mobile music collection consists primarily of full albums but I have rather large folder with selected singles tracks. Naturally Poweramp doenst distinguish between the two and puts all of them in the Library. Each single track with its own entry in the artist and album lists#33; Say you 50 albums and 400 single songs, then both of the Lists will be cluttered with only 1- or 2-track artists you would never look for in this list. Me and I guess most of you would use the search function instead. Therefore the library view is pretty unusable for me#33; It would be nice to have a way to hide those singles in these lists. I see at least two possibilites. The quick and easy to implement one: I manually set the quot;album artistquot; of all my single tracks to quot;Various Artistsquot;. If the tag is present, Poweramp uses it in the artist list instead of the artist tag. The main play view shouldnt be affected by this, I still want to see the real artist there. Getting rid of the album tag (myself) is enough to fix the album list. A much more convenient and less dirty way: add some kind of quot;number of trackquot;-threshhold option in the preferences. Set it to 3 and only artists with more than 2 tracks will show up in the artist list. Thanks for an otherwise awesome software	artist,sort,playlist,album

crosstalk option please#33;	I cannot find this option. Normally when listening to music on speakers a certain amount of crosstalk is introduced. This is natural. On headphones crosstalk creates a similar effect. It allows a certain amount of each channel to bleed into the other channel. This makes listenng on headphones less fatiguing and natural. How well this is executed though is another matter. A DSP plugin into the chain like HeadFit works on PCs. RockBox has it built in on certain MP3 player firmwares. Poweramp appears not to have this feature, which is unfortunate. Any chance of investigating adding it as an option? It makes so much of a difference in the listening experience. Better than any fake surround rubbish IMHO.	playlist,sound,windows,option

embedded cue for mp3	Hi there#33; I was just wondering (as it would be a killer feature for me, I have about 200 dj sets recorded in mp3 format) if there is any technical reason that lossless formats (flac, wv, etc) support embedded cuesheets in Poweramp, but mp3 doesnt? I can create a separate .cue file referencing an mp3 and this works, but it would be much easier to manage if I could embed them in an extended id3 tag (I use isyncr, so copying over cuesheets to match what mp3s are on the phone is a bit of a chore, and also means that my syncd playlists reference the non-cued mp3).

selectable font size for titles, artists and albums	A terrific product as is but I do have one request. In a car when the phone is in a holder it is almost impossible to see text for the song title, album name and the artist name on the main play screen. In fact these are so small that they are pretty much useless at least when Im the driver (Im 56 and the eyes are not what they used to be - think of all of the baby boomers! :geek: ). So the request is for an option where the size of that text is selectable at the expense of the album art size - art definitively needs to stay there but can shrink accordingly. One idea that could work is to be able to do that by swiping over the text info on that screen updown or leftright while keeping the tap for switching to the list. Swiping motion is very convenient in the car. Im talking specifically about the main Play Screen but the FoldersLibrary Lists, the widgets and the Locked Screen could use a larger font option as well for the same reason. Thanks for the consideration :mrgreen:	volume,album art,screen,playlist
multiple equaliser settings per song	Having the ability to have more than one equaliser setting: For instance, I have a number of presets - eg headphones, car etc Some tracks, however can have problems - need more bass etc. I can make a preset for that particular track but it it is going to be based on one of my existing presets (eg headphones + a bit more bass). This is fine if I am listening on my headphones, but not so good if the song comes on while Im driving. For these situations, it would be good to have a preset which adds to the current preset, what ever that preset is. So if Im using the car preset and this track comes on I get car + special track preset, or if Im using my headphones I get headset + special track preset	library,backup,restore,assignments

(it automates the task of turning BTwifi on, connecting to device, and then starting Poweramp and play music) And finally, an optioncheck to turn off Bluetooth on Poweramp exit (and save battery when you finish streaming to BT device) What do you think?	bluetooth,button,ftp streaming,volume

poweramp should use the android #34;force stop#34; as an exit option	Hi, Max has explained many times on this forum and elsewhere that when a user presses Back button to exit the player application, that PA will automatically unload its running processes from Android after some brief time. However, with the recent 2.06 beta I have found this quot;automaticquot; unloading not to be the case, as the notification bar still displayed my last played item even hours after I had stopped using Poweramp and went to sleep. I tried to Kill Poweramp in the Advanced Task Killer android app but this did work, so in Advanced Task Killer I managed to do a quot;Force Stopquot; of Poweramp and this better put my mind at rest with no more notification bar display of Poweramp icon or anything. So I think that Poweramp should get a quot;Force Stopquot; action as a confirmation choice option when pressing Back button to exit Poweramp.... In fact when I exit some Android apps with back button, such as Es File Explorer, I am kindly shown a confirmation message letting me know that pressing back once more time will exit the app and this is what is needed for Poweramp users too.

landscape layout	I would like to request a new layout in landscape that makes the album art more prominent. The current implementation does not make efficient use of the screen real estate.

I think alot of people use this in a dock in the car and better display of the album art would be nice.

I would especially like to have the option to disable the current tracks progress bar while browsing.	display,playlist,widget,lockscreen
can poweramp application be transfered from old phone to new phone?	I recently purchased new phone and my old phone has full version of Poweramp music app. Is it possible to transfer licensing info between phones or will I have to purchase unlock for full version again? Thanks.	version,full version,tag,button
change scrollbar category scroll	Not sure if this is an Android API or something done by Poweramp, but when dragging the scrollbar, I would prefer if it organized it to be # in general, then the alphabet, rather than each number individually getting its own category. It messes me up so badly when I have to pull the bar halfway down the list to get to B when it should logically be near the top.	screen,playlist,library,button

tts on trackalbum change	I have 4000+ tracks and add to themchange them frequently. Would be great if there was an option to read out the artist (or some other artistalbumtrack combination) when the track changes using the standard Android Text To Speech (TTS) engine. When Im in the car (and dont want to look at the small notification bar) it would answer the quot;So whos thatquot; question when I have shuffle selected for my whole music collection. In my case I just want just the artist announced when the artist changes :-)	artist,playlist,sort,version
true voice search a la car tunes	So far, voice search appears to search in the collection. This is no good when you are driving. There should be a gesture or button I can press from the player interface, that pauses the music, and listens to what I want to play, much like Car Tunes has. Also there should be an option to significantly increase font size in the collection browser, and control size everywhere. It is dangerous to have to concentrate on the screen while driving, and this is why Car Tunes is becoming a winner.	control,voice control,voice,search

folder structure with sub folders	Real folder structureWhen using the folder view, all folders are shown, with all subfolders. I use a lot of albums with two cds. Each cd in one subfolder. For example: mainfolder: "album", subfolder: "cd1" and "cd2". At the moment, in folder view, both subfolders are shown, named with their subfolder name "cd1" and "cd2". This is irritating. It would make sense, if only the mainfolders are shown. The subfolders should only be shown, when tapping the mainfolder.For example look at the mortplayer app, where this is working perfectly.	folder,playlist,library,view

user interface improvements	Hi, I started using Poweramp a few days ago and I really liked it. Although I have some comments about the UI. I dont know if its just me but I like things clear and simple. I dont think equ or tone-vol buttons on the top of the player screen are necessary. I mean we dont use them a lot and we can see the same settings just by using the menu button. Its not nice to see a bunch of buttons around. One more thing that I think that is unnecessary is the song quality info at the bottom of the player screen. You dont need to show every single thing on the screen, exspecially the things we dont need much. Also there can be a button such as quot;+quot; in the playlists part. It seems to be really hard to add new lists. One last thing... When we are in the library section and we touch artists for example, the sliding effect is to slow. Nice but slow. If the UI effects can be faster the app will be much more usefull. It would be really great if you guys can make UI improvements like these... Thank you for a great app.	button,screen,library,playlist
change behaviour of lt;lt; and gt;gt; buttons	Thanks a lot for this amazing player! I really love it! My special feature request is the following: Because I listen a lot to quite long talks and lectures ( 1h long), it is very unpleasant if a accidently hit the or button either on the screen or on my BT-headset and the player skips to the next MP3, because I then have difficulites manouvring back to the place I was in my lecture. So what I really would appreciate if I could disable the buttons or even better give them another function: not skip to the previous next song but skip i.e. 30 seconds backward forward within the running song. I would love you even more if you could implement this!! Stefan	button,playlist,widget,screen

sending files through bluetooth...	I think that it would be really handy if in Poweramp you had the ability to send files through bluetooth, like in the default media player (X10 Mini Pro), this could be done by adding it to the little menu that appears under a song when you long press on it. It would be really appreciated if you take this into consideration. Cheers	bluetooth,playlist,folder,screen
two feature requests please read	Hi, I Love Poweramp and have been using it for like a year and a half now, theirs two features Id like to see standard in Poweramp. First I would like a 5-band EQ with a second bass boost knob and virtualizer knob overlay over the 10-band EQ, for example the 5-band EQ would think your already tuned music from the 10-band EQ is standard thus increasing the bass and quality even more. Like combining Music Volume EQ app and Poweramp together, but make it a standard option in Poweramp. Second would be the ability to change the volume level by increments of 1, the Fine Volume app already does this, but Id like this standard in Poweramp, since for some strange reason the app pauses the music when you change the volume with it while using Poweramp.	volume,option,equalizer,button
3 new features i#39;d like to request	First of all this is really the best music player for android. I really like it. It really worths the money to buy it. But I miss 3 features, it would be good to have them: 1 - multiple selection option for playlists to add multiple songs or to delete multiple songs. (not just one song or an entire folder#33;) Now if I want to delete some songs from a playlist, I need to delete them one by one. Its very slow this way#33; 2 - An quot;exitquot;, quot;homequot; or quot;minimizequot; button would be nice for the player. Since the software doesnt have any buttons like this, I always need to push the quot;homequot; hardware button on my device to go back to the main screen of my tablet. Its also working this way, but I dont like to push the hardware buttons so many times on my device, its a really expensive tablet which I have and Im afraid theyll wear out sooner or later if I always use the hardware buttons. 3 - A quot;seek barquot; would be nice for the widget. The player has a seek bar which is good, but the widget doesnt have. So if I want to have a quick listen into the middle of a song I always need to start the full player to do that. It would be good to do that with the widget on the desktop of my tablet. I wouldnt have to always open the full player in that case. Thanks in advance#33;	option,lock screen,delete,button
more individualized sorting options	Hi, the list options that are in Poweramp are good, but what would make them better is to allow sorting of individual folders the way you want them. Most of my folders are proper albums, but I do have a few that are just compilations of songs. The album folders Im fine with being sorted by track#, but I like to sort the compilation folders by title. As it currently stands, youre locked into using one sort method for all folders. My request for this is, along with that default sort order, to add independent list options controls to individual folders. That could be added to the list of options you currently get when you long press on a folder.	screen,library,sort,playlist
status (notification) bar controls	I had this with my standard LG music player.. but my standard LG music player is garbage, basically when you pull down the notification bar it tells you the song youre listening to and has a little album art, and then playpause back a track and forward a track.. itd be a lot more convenient than having to open the app up every time, especially if youre doing something already. I only have the trial version right now but Im guessing its exactly the same as the full (I am buying the full imminently though)	album art,version,button,notification

respect #34;automatically lock#34; security timeout	In ICS there is an option to Automatically Lock either Immediately or after xx seconds. If I enable the Poweramp lock screen (not ICS lockscreen) which I like better because it has many more music controls, it enables immediately instead of waiting the xx seconds set in this option. My feature request would be for Poweramp to wait the specified number of seconds before displaying the lockscreen just like the built in ICS lockscreen does.	lockscreen,lock screen,ics,button
delete button on a lock screen widget	Poweramp has wonderful feature - it allows to delete file from SD card with Delete button. However, to delete a file I have to: 1. Unlock screen 2. Open Poweramp player 3. Call application menu 4. Push Delete button I guess, it could be much more convenient if you add some kind of menu to locking screen widget which is opened by a long tap so that this menu contain Delete item. Than it would be easier to delete current song: 1. Long tap on a lock screen widget 2. Select Delete menu item.	option,lock screen,delete,button
more sorting options please	I need the ability to sort playlists by quot;artistalbumtrackquot; and variations like quot;artistyeartrackquot;.

I believe you can already do this by pressing the song name, So there should be a dedicated button for that instead.	button,library,playlist,screen
reverse stereo channels	Hello, I am requesting a feature to allow the ability to switch the LR channels around. This would benefit people in situations where for comfort or other perhaps medical reasons that need to wear their headphones in the opposite ear or upside down while retaining the stereo mix as intended by the artist. Other than this, I absolutely love the app and bought it last year after my trial period was up.

shuffle ignores songs 15sec #60; x min #60; 10 min option.	Basically a menu option that would make shuffle ignore really long or short mp3s. It would keep ringtones, podcasts, and In-A-Gadda-Da-Vida out of shuffle play. Conversely: A dont index files under X seconds in lengthquot; option. Might lose some intros and outros, but it would save me from gamelofts occasional lack of .nomedia tags.

remember current track and time for each album	Hi#33; I listen often to audiobooks and sometimes I want to switch to a musicfolderalbum.

persistent playlist positions	(The longer I think about this and google around, the more I get the impression that what I want must be pretty esoteric. If there is another way to achieve what I want that I somehow missed, Im all ears#33; Anyway, might as well get it out of my system:) So I find myself listening to music in a number of contexts. One context is quot;regularquot; (in the car or walking somewhere), another one is quot;backgroundquot; (need pleasant unobtrusive music to mask out the work noise), yet another one is quot;runningquot; (need uniformly upbeat music). quot;Backgroundquot; and quot;runningquot; are playlists, quot;regularquot; is just the queue (since Poweramp seems to lack the concept of an automatic quot;Now Playingquot; playlist). What irks me about this arrangement in Poweramp, though, is that whenever I quot;switch contextquot;, the playlistqueue I switch to starts playing from the beginning. Id much prefer it if it would start where I left it when context-switching away. Do I perhaps miss some existing magic configuration knob? Or is this impossible by design? Any alternatives? Thanks#33;	playlist,display,queue,bluetooth
automatically rating of played songs	Very useful and interesting feature - rate the playable tracks according to the time of play and number of repetitions of play. Rating is not assigned if less than 10 percent of the duration of the song heard. The song rating higher, which is fully listened to more times than one that does not fully listened to, and fewer times. I listen to songs from the phone in the car, an airplane, anywhere - would be useful to all this feature#33; Better to save rating of each song in the service area of ??the mp3 file. Rating that is displayed to the user will be seen as 5 stars, each star can be a half. It is better to keep ratings in coded form, which includes information of the number of repetitions and the total time listening. This information can be used to transfer files to your computer for cross-platform, now Im writing a plugin for the player Aimp.	playlist,rate,batch,option

long audio file handling (radio shows, podcasts, spoken word, etc)	Hi Max, I know youve said before that Poweramp isnt really an audiobook player, which is fair enough, but many users are also using Poweramp to play podcasts and radio shows which have much the same sort of navigation issues. There are two really simple little features which would go a long way to alleviating the problems that Poweramp currently has with either of those two audio formats: 1) Add an option to exclude very long audio files from shuffledrandom playback lists. I would suggest making the length user-definable, but if you just want to make it a simple onoff tickbox then Id suggest about 10 minutes would be an appropriate value. 2) Add an option to store the current playback position for any long audio files, so that when something else has been played in the meantime, going back to the original track will automatically re-commence at the last-played position. Again, a user-definable value would be nice, but 10 minutes or so should be fine by default. These two very simple options would be a massive improvement on usability versus the current way that podcasts and other spoken-word files are handled, but without impacting in any way on music playback performance. I would be grateful if you could consider these two additions as at least a small nod toward the many people who have asked for variants of these features in the past, and thank you for all the hard work you put into this application. Andre	screen,play,replay,playlist

individual genre equalisers	Hi, Sorry if this has been bought up before. I have many different genres in my library and finding equaliser settings that work across each of them is difficult.

automatically detect the character set for non-unicode id3 tag, then display the music information properly.	I know that in Poweramp, users can select the character encoding settings and then rescan for music files. However, some users may have music files which non-Unicode ID3 tag encoding are different with other music files that use non-Unicode ID3 tag. For example, I may have Chinese songs and Japanese songs, and all music files ID3 tag were non-Unicode. Assuming that some of my Chinese songs ID3 tag use Simplified Chinese (GB2312 or GBK encoding) character set, Other Chinese songs ID3 tag use Traditional Chinese (BIG5) character set, and all Japanese songs use Japanese character set. If, in Poweramp setting, I set the encoding tag to Simplified Chinese and then rescan the music files, Poweramp may properly display the ID3 tag information for Chinese music files that use ID3 tag encoded in Simplified Chinese, but Poweramps music library may still display garbled text for Chinese songs that use Traditional Chinese (BiG5) encoded ID3 tag and the Japanese songs. While letting users select the encoding for non-Unicode ID3 tag, please also include an option that make Poweramp automatically detect the character encoding of the ID3 tags, then do any of the following: 1. convert the non-Unicode music ID3 tag into Unicode format, then store the information in the music library, but let the users preview the result before store in music library. Or, 2. Store the character set information of ID3 tag of each music file into music library, and make the music library use the stored character set information of each songs to display the information about the songs. Or, 3. beside above, developers can just use any ways to make Poweramp music library properly display the information for each non-Unicode ID3 tags that use different character set. For your information, even though I use Android phones and never use Iphone and Ipad, according to my online research, for all musics, the music application (Ipod) in Iphone and Ipad can properly display the music information regardless of the ID3 tags stored in which character set. If this is true, I hope Poweramp can do the same. Thank you#33;	equalizer,all,repeat option,last played

streaming radio api	I have searched the threads and found some of your basic responses to streaming radio (Pandora, Grooveshark, Slacker, etc...) integration. Since most of these services already provide desktop clients, some even provide mobile clients, they must already provide APIs for their streaming web services. Do you know if any of those providers are willing to work with you on allowing Poweramp to connect via their API to their services? I would imagine that in order to be financially viable those services would only allow access through a 3rd party app (such as PA) for paid subscribers. From the PA side of the equation has there been any research or plans for such integration? I would think that Grooveshark would be a great partnership with PA, and I know that it would bring more paid users to both parties.	ftp streaming,button,version,tag

random album play	One of the favorite things about my Creative Zen player was the quot;Album of the Dayquot; feature. With one click of a button, it would choose a random album on your player and play the songs in order from start to finish. I have over 500 albums on my phone, and I would love the option for Poweramp to randomly choose one to play. I think this request was already made in another post (topic #1867), but Im not sure that the response from the moderator actually pertains to this feature. Or, if it does, I havent been able to figure out how to get Shuffle to accomplish this. If this feature Im requesting is indeed already built in, could someone please walk me through the steps to get it to work? EDIT: As it turns out, the quot;Shuffle Lists, Songs in Orderquot; feature replicates this, but its functionality was a little confusing to me at first. In order to change albums (if you dont like the one that was randomly selected), you can click on the gt;gt;gt; button on the far right to switch to another random album. Thanks Poweramp#33; Second EDIT: Ive figured out why I couldnt get this to work before. You have to choose to play an album through the quot;Albumsquot; part of the library for this feature to work. If you instead enter your music library through quot;Artistsquot; and are playing an album, then the gt;gt;gt; button (even when quot;Shuffle Lists, Songs in Orderquot; is selected) proceeds in order to the next album of the artist (or the next artist in alphabetical order if its the last album of the currently playing artist). Hope this clears things up for someone who was similarly frustrated at first.	playlist,artist,library,album

three new feature requests	Before I start poking holes, I have to say that Poweramp is so far ahead of every other music player for Android that there is basically no competition. That said, here are a few of the things I would like to see implemented or improved: I would like to see an artist-specific implementation of the Album Title tag in cases where two or more artists have albums with the same title. For example, if I go to Greatest Hits in my Album list right now, it says there are 50 tracks on that album, and that its by Journey. In reality, I have three different Greatest Hits compilations in my library. If I play that Greatest Hits album, the first song I get is a Foo Fighters tune, then a Bruce Springsteen tune, THEN Journey. It seems to be parsing the list first by track number, then alphabetically by track title. It would be great if the album list said: Greatest Hits (Bruce Springsteen) Greatest Hits (Foo Fighters) Greatest Hits (Journey) And then allowed me to play whichever one I want. This, along with the implementation of the Album Artist tag mentioned in another thread, are the two biggest holes I see in the app. Next, I would love to be able to control volume via the main player screen. Maybe allow me to set either the list controls or Volume via the updown swipe?

poweramp #38; possibilities of google music (hypothetical question)	Was going to go on a rant on why you guys dont support steaming from Google Music since surely they have an API Then after a quick Google search it seems... there is no API support :| Thus this request is moreso on the burden of Google for not doing API support that would allow for easier access to their service which is great but, their music app seriously seriously sucks balls for Android... which I can kinda blame you guys for spoiling me But this leads to my main question, ifwhen Google decides to do API for Google Music, you guys think itd be possible to fit that in PowerMP as far as the GMusic library accessible for playback?	api,soundcloud,google,button
feature request: shake to skip, miui style lyrics	I love Poweramp. Its the only app Ive ever paid for, and its worth every penny. I think the feature set is adequate, but I noticed two really cool features in the stock MIUI music player (1.7.15 onwards) which, if incorporated into Poweramp would make this THE BEST app on the android market. The first is linking the accelerometer to skip the current song. Ive seen this in the most basic of players, so it would be really cool to have as when Im driving I dont want to have to unlock my phone to skip the current track. Should be able to shake little to skip the song, more to skip the playlist folder etc. The second, to automatically download and display scrolling karaoke style lyrics. MIUI does this really well, but I hate having some Chinese text show up randomly. The MIUI equalizer sucks, and this is the main reason why I love Poweramp - the sounds frikin amazing! Please try and include these two (rather rare) features in the next major release. Thanks, and keep up the amazing work!	display,playlist,lyrics,screen
sound hound lyrics	Love Poweramp , the only app that I have purchased from the android market. I would like to have the Sound Hound feature together with Poweramp. Sound Hound is an app that allows you to recognize the music by listening to it, it also has a feature that allows you to see the lyrics of the song in real time, so if it recognizes a 3 minutes song at the 1:30 minutes, the lyrics will start in that same location and will scroll down together with the music. Also the option to download the song lyrics from your complete music library automatically would be nice.	lyrics,tag,display,playlist
high pass, low pass #38; band pass filters	Ideally Id like to have the option to use use the Bass and Treble controls as frequency selectable High Pass and Low Pass filters, at some preset or even selectable slope of attenuation 12dB, 18dB, or 24dBoctave. Depending on how the DSP is coded and processed on a specific device, filters have several advantages over Tone Controls or an Equalizer: #183; potential power savings with minimal impact on bass #183; lower signal processingpower demand then EQ or Tone Controls#183; only way to effectively attenuate over-modulation distortion#183; DC offset protection #183; driver over-modulation protection#183; adjustable attenuation of alias artifacts in poor source material#183; improve intelligibility of news, pod-casts, talking books#183; improve intelligibility for all audio sources for the hearing impaired people#183; adjustable noise reduction#183; exclusive DSP not offered on any other media player Filters are easier for most Users to adjust for desirable results, easier to code then Tone or EQ filters, and technically theres no reason they couldnt be used in conjunction with the Equalizer for better performance though I personally dont regard that as necessary for the value of the feature to be full realized.	filter,convolution,equalizer,version

list filtering	In list views (in artist and albums primarily) there is likely to be a large number of entries with just one or a few songs (the quot;hitsquot;) and the some with more songs (the favourite artists). I propose that an option to filter out entries with less than x songs when lists are displayed - and a way to show all. This would make the view easier to use to find a specific artist and in case of looking up a specific hit then search or the show all could be used. Thx for a great player	playlist,artist,search,sort
mono routing	Hi, I was looking for an application to listen play-a-long mp3 (Aebersold) where the drum is centered, while bass is on the left and the piano is on the right. So using the balance Ive the choice to remove the piano (which Im playing) while keeping drum and bass (I need pratically only the left channel for my job). I would like also to have a mono feature, so that I can hear this both on left and right headphone (and not only in one ear which it is not confortable while playing). I was happy to see that your application has both balance and mono (not quite diffused these controls among players) but unfortunately the current routing is, according to my test: mono -gt; balance (that means you first go mono than the balance does nothing) while could be more useful having: balance -gt; mono (first select the channel to be used among leftright, than put the risult in mono to hear this in both ears). This last routing has all the benefits of the currently implemented one, but has this extra possibility thats useful for my job. Having worked in mixer design I mean moving the balance control before (and not after) the mono block. Dont know if the actual routing specification (mono -gt; balance) has been done like that for a particular reason (please explain) but it looks to me that the other routing (balance -gt; mono) looks more flexible (hope to be right). Any comment ? Is there any chance to have this routing changed (swapped), so that also song called quot;minus onequot; has good choice to be played? Thanks in advance for your time.

auto dj functionality mode	One of the great features of Poweramp is its crossfading functionality (and gapless fading). It makes it much more DJ-like and much more fun to listen to music. Now how about adding a mode in which one just sees a playlist or folder list and with touching a specific list or folder it automatically begins playing the list without leaving that view. Currently one can press on the right hand side and options will appear (one of them is PLAY). You can even adjust in settings to not enter the list view and just begin playing the list from that view. However, Im talking about a special mode with a commercial focus. Lets say, you rent audio equipment for parties and wish to offer an integral solution for the music. A solid, fool proof mode for AutoDJ functionality where the customer cant exit the mode (a special gesture needed) and where he only sees lists genres folders which he can touch to begin playing them. It could also be used for automating music in your home. Imagine your tablet hanging on the wall, displaying just playlists or genres and with a press of a button it automatically begins playing music on the enabled sections of your home. Just an idea for the Poweramp programmers.	playlist,widget,folder,library

time saving idea when building playlists	I have an idea to save users some a couple steps when building playlists. Currently, when a user long presses on a song, they have to select quot;Add to Playlistquot; then select a playlist from the list of existing playlists. It would be great time saver if a user you could long press a song then be given the option to add it to the most recently selected playlist. Possibly a dynamic menu option such as quot;Add to xxxquot; where xxx is the most recent playlist name. If there isnt a most recent playlist, this menu option would either not appear or ???. If you can imagine building a playlist of 30+ songs in one sitting, this would be a huge time saver. Thanks for the consideration.	playlist,option,album,library

larger audio buffer for hard drive devices	Using an Archos 80 g9 250gb. I know there arent too many hard-drive based Android devices, but the market is certainly there for those of use with very large media collections. Id love to have an additional buffer setting beyond the quot;large, 750msquot; because this buffer still is not large enough to give the hard drive time to spin up. I would hope its an easy fix... I would assume the buffer requires at minimum several secondsheres hoping its as simple as changing one number in the code. Problem experienced: only with higher bitrate MP3 files (200kbps to 320kbps) every 5 seconds it will pause and artifact. Note, FLAC and lower bitrate MP3 files all appear to work fine, which leads me to believe there must be a simple solution for this. I would pay 10x the price for Poweramp to have this feature#33;	playlist,volume,library,widget

What if I would rather be able to Long Press the title and I was given a choice of where I wanted to go.

lockscreen even when music isn#39;t playing #33;	I would like to finally see the lockscreen working even when the music isnt playing in Poweramp. maxmp Posted 25 October 2011 - 06:09 AMHi,currently, Poweramp (both 1.x and 2.0 versions) shows lock screen only when music is playing and hides when music is stopped. Though, Im thinking about adding option to force Poweramp lock screen even if music is not playing in Poweramp. This will require Poweramp service to be loaded in all times.

minimalist ui options	I love the features that this player has, but stopped using the player because of the cluttered UI.The solution to make everybody happy would be to allow aspects of the Now Playing Screen to move or be hidden. My android device has physical play, pause and skip buttons as well as an adjustable EQ. Having playskip icons and the massive EQ strip drape over the top of my screen becomes redundant and clutters the environment. If I need to switch songs with the screen on, I would use the swipe function or widget. Please add the feature to hide these icons for a better user experience.

longpress volume rocker control volume, short press switch tracks	When the screen is off, and on the lock screen widget, it would be a dramatic improvement to add a function to longpress volume keys to change the volume (in 13 second increments) , and short press to change the track. Also like in PlayerPro, it would be sweet to be able to swich functionality (longpress for track change, short press for volume up=next, down=previous). This is a feature that I love and is a must for when I go jogging. Curently only PlayerPro has it, and have it down PERFECTLY but the audio engine sucks. Would like very much to keep using Poweramp with this **crucial** feature. I love Poweramps audio engine over all other players and therefore not having this control makes Poweramp incomplete for me. This seems to be a common issue among Android users that are not running Cyanogen Mod.	volume,screen,button,hardware

changable artwork with customized locations	Hey. First of all this is great application. So great job#33; Secondly, some people who use foobar with certain artwork plugins, know of that feature. This is so that artwork changes with random(or fixed depended on the setting) time intervals, and changes either in linear or random way. Is it possible you couldmake this feature, so that the artwork of the song changes? Currently there is one image that is quot;assignedquot; to the song or the album and thats it. But for those (like me ) who did spend their time on doing image collections for the albums to shuffle through artwork constantly this would be a great feature. For it to work though, you would also add a configurable folder sellection. To be more precise, it would be very bad idea, to have say 20 different images in the same folder as the sound files. It wouldnt look good, it wouldbt be also good idea from organising stand of point. What I have for instance, is in the album folder, I have a folder named ArtWork, and inside it I have only the images, that are displayed in random order, when the songs from that album are played. However it can be any name of the folder, or even folders if you wish. Its all customizable, again. Anyways, any chance you guys might think of that and implement it in some future versions? cheers Lucas	folder,playlist,album art,library

bring back old skins and layout option please.	I paid for the full version of Poweramp a long time ago and loved it. Shortly afterwards 2.0 came out and I feel like I wasted my money since then. The old skin layout was vastly superior. The skins themselves were much more attractive (mainly quot;White Plasticquot;). Please put a little time and effort into the skins. 2.0 is nice featurewise, but it looks like the skins were just thrown together. A major reason I nitpick so much on the skins is that I used Poweramp as a car audio player. Which leads me to another point: the 2.0 Poweramps landscape skin mode is nowhere near as functional for that purpose.	tablet,version,skin,widgets

You could also include a "via Poweramp" append text with a tiny url to your site.

In the Folders view it shouldnt be a problem, since swiping left and right isnt used in any way. The same goes for the Library. The only problem might be in the Player view, which uses swiping to change songs. But still, its used just in Coverflow, so there is place where the buttons are and where song info such as a title and artist is. I have seen these swipe capabilities in so many apps so I guess it should not be that big a problem. Would be glad to see that#33; Cheers, Battlefield	library,playlist,artist,queue

pass thru mode with nothing touching the signal except da and amplification	Before I bought Poweramp I gave it a listen. My old phone was a Nexus One, and when I listened to songs on it, I thought the midrange was more lifelike and had a lot more presence and texture. When I played the same song on my new Galaxy Nexus using Poweramp I was disappointed in the sound. When I played it on the Galaxy Nexus using the stock music player it was closer to the Nexus One, it was better in the midrange. I suspect I had a Poweramp setting that was colouring the sound. Or maybe the Nexus One player was colouring the sound. In any event Id like a direct setting that turns off everything but DAC and amplification, the proverbial straight wire with gain. It would usually be used for classical, or when you wanted to compare to another source. Now, I dont know what DACs the two phones have, and how they should compare. Ive spend a lot of time and money on audio equipment with Burr-Browns but never looked at smartphones. Unfortunately Im too discriminating and picky when it comes to sound.

volume control bar	Hi#33;My Poweramp was updated automatically yesterday.And a BIG BIG problem that I have is that there is no (good) new volume control bar#33;You can activate the volume menue while taping once on the album art, but I think there should be a customization which allows to see this option always on top (not over the CD cover gt;.lt;) just at the bottom or something like that. Like it was before.I used the Poweramp software volume switch EVERY time AND I could see exaytly(At the volume level bar that appears) how the volume is set.

albumplaylist specific randomize	Since theres the option to set equalizer settings to a specific filealbumplaylist I think it wouldnt be too difficult to do something similar with albumsplaylist and playback options such as randomize or something like that. Of all my albums there is only one that i like randomized and its quite difficult to remember to switch the playback option every time I switch albums. Another idea to do that (since I cant seem to think of any other usability to an album specific playback options) is to make a feature that would change the track number of every file in an album to a random one.	playlist,artist,option,folder
extended title scrolling	If Ive noted correctly it looks like if the title of the song andor the artistalbum title of the song are longer than the screen then it looks like they will scroll for the first 30 or so seconds of when a second starts, when a song is paused then continued, and if the app is put in the background and then brought back to the screen. Im assuming if both song title and artistalbum title are long they alternate scrolling during that period. One of the things I use to like about my Zune HD was that in play mode the screen saver would continuously scroll these titles (I have alot of long titles). Id love to see an option that would allow you to turn on the ability to continue to scroll those titles (alternating between the two lines scrolling if necessary) for the duration of the song instead of just during the startup periods Ive noted above.	display,title,playlist,scrolling title

In folder view, that I often use, when I tap on a song the UI jumps back to the Play modescreen which isnt an ideal behaviour since Id still want to choose another song to listen to instead of the last selected song.

queue management	I like the new dynamic queue but I think theres some room for improvement. The best queue management Ive seen is at grooveshark.com. Several desktop music players have similar control but grooveshark does it with the best visual flair (unfortunately not everything they do is as beautiful).The most important feature here is the ability to select a song to play: [*:3hqp9zpu]now (inserts it into the slot immediately following the current song in the queue and advances to it)[*:3hqp9zpu]next (inserts it into the next slot like the play now option but doesnt advance to it until the current song finishes)[*:3hqp9zpu]and last (inserts it after the last song in the queue)The queue doesnt delete songs once they have been played so it acts as a record of the songs played in that session.It is fully re-orderable and traversible. In grooveshark you can reorder with drag and drop and click on any item to switch to it.The queue can be manually cleared (or have items removed from it), and it can be its state can be saved as a playlist.This has many benefits beyond graphical niceness. It allows you to have more transparency about how the app is picking songs. If you code it so that the shuffle button shuffles the queue (instead of randomly traversing it) you can see what songs are coming up and edit them if you like. It makes it infinitely easier to make a playlist, giving you the option to fiddle to your hearts content before saving.Id be happy to provide screen-shots of groovesharks example and answer any questions	playlist,queue,play,reset
no shuffle in queue	Hi, I have a feature proposal regarding the current queue implementation and shuffle mode. Although I still think the current approach to song queuing may be a bit too complicated and confusing for many people (see some of the confused reactions in the forums) it has its advantages and could become even more useful with a simple feature addition. Currently when you play a folder with shuffle on and enqueue an album you need to turn off shuffle manually in order to play the album (or custom song selection) in the right or desired order. On top of that when the queue finishes always the SECOND song in the original folder (the one you had playing on shuffle) starts to play. This is fairly logical but quite annoying. What I suggest is an OPTION not the shuffle songs added to the queue even when shuffle (either folder or library based) is turned on globally. This way I could listen to a folder of random songs or the whole library on shuffle and when I thought of a specific album or selection of songs to play I could just enqueue them, listen to them in the order I DESIRE (even manipulate the queue in the process) and after the queue is finished return to playing the original folder or whole library on shuffle all without ever having to touch the shuffle switch and having to listen to the second second in the original folder for the millionth time. I think this is a reasonable suggestion that would immensely enhance the user experience. Please consider it. Thanks! Petr	--,04 apr 2011,shuffle,queue

please modify the function of the volume buttons#33;	Hello guys, I think I created a similar thread for that some months ago, but I aint sure no more. So sorry for creating this one. PowerMP is really a great app and Im so happy that I bought it. However, please fix this volume button problem that is unfortunately an Android problem#33; Its such a pity that the volume gets increaseddecreased so inaccurately when you press the volume buttons. PowerMP has a master volume bar and an extra volume bar. These options give users a perfect possibility to adjust their favorite volume. Well, but many users dont hold their cell phones in their hands when theyre listening to music. Pressing the volume buttons is never a problem, though, but its almost useless since its so inaccurate. Itd be perfect if PowerMP had an option that lets you adjust how many percent the volume gets increaseddecreased when you press the specific volume button or for example to set up the volume steps, 64 instead of 16, or 32 instead of 16 etc. Please, we aint no dogs that could hear any theoretical quality loss since someone mentioned 16 was a perfect number to adjust volume, it just aint#33; If that was true, all the MP3 players out there would have hearable quality loss cause they got more than 16 volume steps. Honestly guys, I cant see that ugly green Android volume bar no more - it makes me angry and sick#33; All those Apple guys laugh at Androids ridiculous volume system We should teach em a lesson#33; I got a Samsung Galaxy S2 with Android 2.3.4 and the newest version of PowerMP and the unlocker of course.

genre request	Hello, Most of the time I listen to music while driving my daily route to work and back. Operating your phone while driving is not recommandable, so anything you do should be without to much hassle. When I want to listen to some music, I usually do this by choosing the genre (which reflects more or less the mood Im in;-), then the album, then select the entire album for playing or a specific song within that album. Heres my problem: I have 200+ albums on my sdcards, containing 2500+ songs, all tagged with genre. When going in through genre, it shows all songs in that genre. Since some genres contain hundreds of songs, it is almost impossible to scroll through, especially when driving. Would it be possible to have an option to choose whether you want a list of the albums (and then songs) or just songs when entering your library via genre? Btw: I also noticed that the slider on the right, does not indicate the alphabet letter, when scrolling through the song list in a genre. Regards, TiNNiT	playlist,genre,library,equalizer
playlists ....again; how about option to create m3us automatically?	Hi....from looking around I see that playlists are a constant topicthe inability to easily backup in Android and the awkward creation is a continuing pain. With 10 year old technology on a Palm Treo, it is faster and simpler using programs like Ptunes. The recent change in the way playlists was handled was a nice and thoughtful improvement, a step in the right direction, but only a step. At least now it is POSSIBLE to deal with playlists on the device. It is still awkward enough so that I wind up creating them from my desktop, and that shouldnt have to be. The key problem is that I want to keep them both backed up and in a universally useable format (like m3u or whatever) that I can use across devices and systems. The new feature allowing creation and then export to m3u or similar is a reliefnow its possible at least. But my question is....why the multi-step process? When you go to create a playlist, why cant it simply ask you (or allow you to have predefined options) how you want it done? Let it go through the creationconversionexport process in the background if that is how Android has to fumble around, but I should be able to create a useable and backup-pable playlist from the get go, not have to go through this 5 step process: (1) create on device; 2. go into Poweramp settings; 3 choose to exportconvert to a useable format I can control and backup; 4 delete the original creation, since clearly I dont need dupes; and finally; 5 move the exportedconverted format into the folder where I keep my actual useable and backup-pable playlists. Thats 5 steps. It could just be that when you go to create a playlist, it simply asks you where you want to save it and in what format (or you predefine those preferenceseven better#33;). Done. No muss, no fuss. If Android doesnt allow that in one step,. since the program clearly has the ability to export and convert now, let that process go on invisibly behind the scenes, eliminating all the user-annoying steps outlined above. Thanks for listening. P.s. Along a similar concern on backing upwhen you edit tags, if you then copy the song back to your desktop, does the tag remain? Or is that just from the playlist?	equalizer,all,repeat option,last played

This is stupid as the home button does this. Instead, the back button should go back a folder, i.e. to the albums track list. The back button works the way it should when navigating through the Poweramp home screenartistablum however when you get to now playing and use it, it takes you back to the android home screen instead of taking you back to the albums track list. Can we get a fix for this? Thank you	button,screen,playlist,folder

lists not ordered correctly (or the way i would like it)	Hi, Im a new Android user and new Poweramp user. Ive tried many alternatives over the past week or two and Poweramp seems to be by far the cleanest, smothest music experience. Congrats on a great piece of software#33; There are just two things that are bugging me a little bit and they have to with ordering of songs. (Im sorry if this post gets confusing from here but its not that easy to explain#33;). When you order a list by title its seems to do - Symbols gt; # gt; A-Z and it does not ignore opening brackets. So for example my Albums list appears: (Whats the Story) Morning Glory by Oasis ...And Justice For All by Metallica 1984 by Van Halen The A Team by Ed Sheeran Absolution by Muse I think the correct way to order this list (which is the way an iPodiPhone does it) would be to ignore symbols completely and start with the first letter of the first word. Also to order it A-Z gt; # rather than # gt; A-Z. Secondly, in the All Songs list it does not ignore words like The and A so tracks like quot;A Groovy Kind of Love by Phil Collinsquot; will appear under the quot;Aquot; section rather than quot;Gquot;. This is not consistent with the behaviour shown in the Artists or Albums view where an album such as quot;The Battle of Los Angeles by RATMquot; will appear under quot;Bquot; (quite correctly). All this would change my list above to: The A Team by Ed Sheeran Absolution by Muse ...And Justice For All by Metallica ... ***All albums from A-W*** then.... ... (Whats the Story) Morning Glory by Oasis ... *** All albums from W-Z*** then... ... 1984 by Van Halen Anyway, Im sure that was as clear as mud#33; I wonder what the other forum goers think and whether you could add this behaviour to sort lists? I appreciate your time.	playlist,artist,shuffle,queue
player screen is cluttered	I generally love the new update, however the player screen is now clutter with redundant buttons; for instance at the top of the player screen is equalizer settings button, a equalizer button and and tone and volume button. My problem is all these settings can also be found by merely pressing Menu on the phone and then hitting equalizer. Then there are the shuffle and repeat buttons which I seem to change putting my phone back into my pocket. My main overall problem is that I unable to change them, I can see other people would like these buttons but I have a small phone screen and would rather see album art then redundant buttons and even when I go to Settingsgt;Look and Feel and then to the subsection Player UI I press hidden on all the options...Nothing becomes hidden, nothing changes. What is going on?	button,library,screen,equalizer
eq presets to be saved for album even when listening to playlists?	Let me explain my situation; I have tons of albums on my Poweramp, however, I usually listen to them on playlists (like All songs or created playlists). When listening to an album and you want to change EQ for all its songs its very easy, because its in the choices when you save an EQ for any of its songs. However, when listening to playlists, and you want to change the EQ of the song youre listening to, you can do it and save it - but you cant do it for its whole album, only its playlist. Why this is so important to me: Many of my albums play at different volumes, so its a huge pain in the ass to lower the volume or raise after every song, and with EQ you can save a particular volume so all songs would be leveled. But since one album usually has one particular volume level, it would be extremely useful if you could save EQ for the whole album even from the playlist. So I ask - would this be hard to add? Basically when you save EQ for the song in a playlist, could there be a choice for quot;albumquot;? Please, if its easy to do, it would be EXTREMELY useful for me.	playlist,equalizer,genre,volume
random album within playlist	It would be a great feature to be able to shuffle albums within a playlist. I have tons of music on my phone and i also listen to it when i workout. But i dont want any Celine Dion music poppin up while im running for instance. So i have a workout playlist with only fast music, but i dont seem to be able to shuffle through the albums in that playlist. It just shuffles all albums on my phone.	playlist,display,album,queue
more columns in grid view (to display more albums at once)	First off, I would just like to say that Poweramp is the most complete and best-looking mobile music player I have ever used. I have used it for about a year now, and I like it better than Zune, Sansa, any other Android music player, and needless to say the iPhoneiPods limited and extremely overrated players. The introduction of Grid View in Poweramp 2.0 is great, but I wish it would display more albums at once. On a fundamental level, displaying album art is much easier to recognize than displaying text - if you know your album covers as well as I do. But in my case, Grid View becomes difficult to use with 160+ albums and only two columns. Currently I can display six albums at once on my 4quot; Samsung Captivate screen (with my LCD density set to 165, as opposed to the supremely oversized Samsung default of 240). I am suggesting a 3, 4, or even 5 column view which would roughly allow me to display 12-25 albums on the screen at once. I can already hear everybody screaming, quot;No, the album art thumbnails will be way too small#33;quot; But think about it. If I can scroll through 160 albums with a single flick of my finger, not only does it look cool, but most importantly it is functional. As Android users, we are already used to it - it would be like an App Drawer for our music player#33; I realize its easy for us as users to come up with a million different features we all want, but if you at least consider an expanded Grid View, consider me a happy user.	album art,view,library,playlist
need my easy folder view back#33; pleease#33;	Before 2.0, you could be listening to an album(folder) and, with a long-press on the titlecounter, you could go back to the folder list and switch to another album. Now that long-press brings up ArtistAlbumFolder pop-up. Pressing quot;folderquot; takes you to the CURRENT folder. Then, you can hit quot;folderquot; again, or press the top of the screen, and it will finally take you to the list. The best way I can figure out to get back to the list in 2.0 is to hit the MENU key(Droid x) then hit Folders. At any rate, its become more of a chore to switch folders, especially for someone, like me, who does most of their listening while driving.. This, and the problem with the albumart.jpg files not showing up, makes going from the old, nearly flawless, Poweramp to 2.0 pretty disappointing. Im sure the albumart bug will be fixed, but I REALLY hope you can streamline the folder switching. Maybe an option to go back to the old long-press method? Or is there something Im missing?? Thank you#33;	button,setting,folder,playlist

The thing is that I cannot find a proper headset for my Nexus S after the original one became monotone (not surprised at that poor quality). I noticed major (e.g. Sennheiser, and Im in Germany...) headphone manufacturers only have single-function(by single-function I mean only one button) standard versions and featured iphonenokia versions (that will not work on android).... And I really dont require much... some decent sound quality, three-button control, non-blue-tooth (always forget to charge them) .... or any other suggestions? thx#33; p.s.

volume buttons	Hi friends, Congratz regarding V 2.0. I have two questionsrequests: Is it possible that you remove the standard function of the volume buttons? There is an app called Minesweeper (the game with the mines). The newest version of that games changes the volume buttons so that you can use them for other games. I thought it might be possible that Poweramp can also change their functions. The standard Android volume bar is pretty lame because it is too inaccurate. Poweramp 2 features much better volume control. If the volume buttons could control Poweramps volume, it would be great. There is also a tool called quot;Fine Volume Control 2quot;. You can check that too. Im not sure if you devs can benefit from such programs in case youre able to see the source code. The other question: Is that new volume bar in Poweramp 2 the same as the master equalizer? If I press the volume buttons so that the lame android volume control comes up, I see that the volume bar of Poweramp changes too. So if I change the Poweramp volume bar myself (without the buttons) it looks like I can change the volume very accurately. Is this really true or just fake?^^ P.S. My cellphone: Samsung Galaxy S2 with Android 2.3.4. Thanks	volume,button,control,option
web based control	Good evening#33; I updated to the new pro version and it is great#33; Runs very good on my SGS 2, thanks for your work#33; My idea for a new feature is to add a web based GUI for controlling Poweramp. I dont know if some people think the same, for me it would be a nice feature. I put my mobile on dock at home and connect it to my amplifier by bluetooth. Everytime I like to change an track or something I must go trough my rooms and select it. If there is a web GUI (for example with a StartStop option), you can connect to the phone and controll things like nextprevious track, folder updown and all the things you can in a widget. I thik, this would be a nice feature. I dont know, is it possible yet with the API you provide? Or as a plugin for the PAW server? Regards BoRsTiE	playlist,bluetooth,widget,version
a retro cassette #39;rewind#39; noise effect	Hi, The title of the topic says it all. remember that ole re-wind or fast-forward noise-effect sound we get when doing the aforementioned in out cassette players. Just like this; I know its possible with digital audio but I dont know how feasible it is with Android, given Android devices sometimes limited processing power for such effects. Maybe such feature as this could be at users own risk but definitely would run fine on higher-specced devices. Could PA offer support for this fancy feature effect in future?	playlist,sound,srs,display
artist albumssongs shuffle?	I love to be able to shuffle all songs for a particular artist from all of hishertheir albums. If I fancy a bit of Oasis id like to shuffle my complete collection of Oasis albums instead of shuffling through one of their albums and having to change album to get more. Is this possible? Artist pictures would be a nice touch too, similar to Player Pro. although the option to turn that off and not download the images should be added with it, incase users dont want to waste space on their sd card for the images which arent essential.	artist,playlist,shuffle,sort
biggerhigher contrast track details in lock screenplayer	In the main player screen and lock screen the artist and album details are printed in a pale greyblue text using light strokes on a dark background, making it very hard to read on my HTC Desire (and, I suspect, many other small screen devices) in normal or filtered daylight. The song title is printed in larger, bold trext and is easier to read, but I would still prefer it to be either larger or higher contrast. Id like to be able to quickly check the artist or album at a glance, and thats just not possible for me right now. Id really like to see an option to change either the text or background colour, or perhaps choose a larger font or one with a heavier stroke weight.	widget,album art,lock screen,option
album sorting after choosing a single song search result	Right now the current behavior after searching for a song title and selecting it is to either: a) Play the rest of the filtered search queue, or b) Continue playing the next song(s) in the quot;All songsquot; alphabetical list The behavior Id like is similar to (b), but Id like the player to have an option to continue in album order after the selected song is done (perhaps in the album sorting method thats been chosen for artist album pages, like alphabeticalyearetc.). Example scenario: Lets say I want to listen to quot;Taxmanquot; by The Beatles. What currently happens when I search for quot;Taxmanquot;: 1) quot;Taxmanquot; by The Beatles plays (track 1 on Revolver). 2) The next song alphabetically on my phone plays - which happens to be quot;Teddy Boyquot; by Paul McCartney, then quot;Teethquot; by Lady Gaga, etc. What Id like to happen when I search for quot;Taxmanquot;... 1) After the song finishes, the next song on the album plays - quot;Eleanor Rigbyquot; (track 2 on Revolver). 2) If I leave my phone running, the next Beatles album should play after Revolver... and then the next artist after The Beatles when thats all done. (This would be the exact behavior if I manually selected quot;Taxmanquot; on its album page). This shouldnt be too difficult to implement, I hope. It just makes a lot more sense to me than forcing the player to continue quot;all songsquot; alphabetically. Keep up the amazing work#33; Poweramp 2.0 is fantastic.	artist,album,sort,playlist
alphabet scrolling	Hi,Can we have alphabet scrolling for library lists, folder lists, like in this example pic:Ive seen this feature PlayerPros music player (close rival Android music app) and I was amazed.

a track indicator (please)	Hi,I would like to see this track indicator info. I hope I am not reposting an earlier request.XXXXXor you know..23105..So in that hypothetical situation that would appear when starting playback on the 23rd track of a any playlist.I expect that this feature would be configurable in that have the ability to set the delay time e.g. show for 10 secs before it fades away. The best place to display this IMO, on the already crammed UI, would be over the album art area using a standard small Android UI grey box (with mild transparency). Would also like to see it available on the widgets too.Its the same text box that is seen when an Android user presses the Back button to exit file managers such as ASTRO or Es File Explorer.I put it in the corner in this mock-up I created however it might be best centered, I dunno:(click image to enlarge)Sorry for epic post, I like to be clear with my ideas and requests.	album art,bluetooth,display,screen
use volume control button for track selection	This is a near perfect music player for adroid tablets and phones and easily beats other competitors. Ive got one request to make our tablets and phones operate more like mp3 players: I wish we could have the option to use the volume up and down buttons for track forward and backward (e.g., when the screen turns off). That way, we dont have to turn on the screen and go to Poweramp to select a track. We need this function either when we dont like the currently playing song or music and wish to get to the next track or if we like the last song or music and wish to go back and listen one more time.

default playlist	Hi! First of all, just say thanks to the dev team, because this is the best mp3 app Ive used so far. Ive been using the free version, and I have just upgraded to the paid one. I have two sugeestions (the second will be in another post, in order to keep them separated). Would it be possible to keep a "default playlist", like winamp, for example? I explain: right now, when you want to play files, you can play by folder, artist, genre, etc... but if you want to play some random files, you have to create a playlist, add files to that playlist, and later select "play playlist". It would be more usable if instead, you could do "add to current playlist", and then the selection would be added to the list of songs to play. This default playlist should be kept between shutdowns, and you could also export as a playlist. Forgive me if thos can be done in some way, but I have not been able to do it. Currently Im only using folder or artistalbum play, because its not very usable to saveload playlist every time you want to add songs. Anyway... its a GREAT program. Alex	playlist,folder,play,widget

jump to album from a track in the #39;all#39; list	Hi, im using Poweramp for a couple of weeks now and i really love it. Ive replace my iPhone with a Samsung Galaxy S2 and im amazed about the difference in sound quality. Poweramp gives such a great and clear sound#33; Now there are only 2 small things i would really like to see in the Poweramp app and i would never even have to think about switching back. 1. when a track is playing, it would be really great if you could open the album it is on. For example, if im playing all my tracks on shuffle, sometimes i hear a track and it reminds me of the whole album or just one other track which is on that album. On the ipod you could just simply flip the album art cover over and see all the other tracks on that album. If you touched one of them it would start playing and would continue playing that album. Would a simulair function be possible on Poweramp? I would really like to see this. So much i would buy the app again tbh. 2. a search function in the player which is acceseble at all times. Greetings, Jonne	playlist,album art,album,version

multi select songsalbumsfolders for playlists	I like to create playlists by Genre. If I want to create an aLT playlist I need to go into either folders or artist and long-press on each one and add to playlist.

This would speed things up tremendously and not make having to recreate my playlist such a chore.	playlist,button,library,folder
2 searching tweaks	Id like it if when you start typing from one of the library views, it starts searching in that view. So if I go to All Songs and start typing, it lists songs that match (and nothing else). Right now, you need to press the search key, then tweak the list to only show songs.Searches feel a little cluttered to me, because I almost always search by song title, then sometimes by artist. From the search view, theres a quot;list optionsquot; where I can disable everything but song title if I want. A better option (in my opinion) would be to reorder the options, so song titles show up first and then artist and then everything else. That way I dont have to either type more than necessary, or scroll down past any artists that might show up (given I have 700+ artists, its likely that therell be an artist hit when Im trying to search by title)Thanks#33; Otherwise, 2.0 is looking pretty good#33;	search,artist,library,playlist

ability to load audio-only of any video files (ffmpeg)	Hi,I have some FLV videos of rare groove music that I ripped from YouTube some time ago. These videos basically have just a still image of the artistband with the main audio track playing.This is an example of such a video; You see in no way am I requesting that Poweramp become a video player. NO. But Im just wanting if Poweramp could loaddecodeplayback the audio-only of video file by adding itself to the video file handler in Android.I should think that Poweramp uses that same FFMPEG source as apps like MoboPlayer and RockPlayer do meaning a great variety of audio and video formats are supported.btw, perhaps a prompt message (that could be disabled) could display to state something like "Poweramp does not support the playback of video. Never."	video,codec,button,display
please give permission to drm files please	can you please give permission to listen to *.dcf files so we can listen to it? hello i am in love with the Poweramp app since it is the best music app in the world. with better user experience and better sound quality. the thing is the korean music sites give permissions for its users to listen to dcf files from samsung, lg or devices its partner with. so with the device you have let you listen to the dcf files, it allows you to listen with any app if the app gives permissions to open dcf. the music sites is the biggest music sites in korea with millions customers. the music app they give isnt good and you know Poweramp is better than samsung stock music app. a lot of people use playerpro instead of Poweramp because of this, even tough it is not as good. this is not illegal. this is legal and there will be no trouble. the drm is signed to the devices not what music app it is played to. please consider doing it. you will have so many more users from korea. thank you	version,tag,search,playlist

dealbreaking features for me	So Ive been debating between Poweramp and other media apps. There are a few dealbreaking features, that would push me towards purchasing Poweramp, namely: 1) Text-box library search 2) Star ratings Now I know those two are said to be implemented in the update, and I can wait for them, but could someone tell me if the rest are already implemented, or included in the next updates? Or neither?! 3) Auto playlists (Recently played, Most played, Recently added etc) 4) Volume keys as nextprevious track (i.e. hold volume UP for next track, volume down for previous) 5) Jump to library from lock-screen widget when album art is clicked 6) Columns in "All Songs" list to arrange list by TitleArtists (like in your regular Winamp or Windows media player on the PC) Cheers!	playlist,volume,library,button

extended tags: #39;publisher#39; #39;composer#39; #39;copyright#39; etc	I requested this feature to Max in an email and he already stated that this is planned (in some way) for Poweramp.Basically I requested if Poweramps Info window would add, as permanent tag fields, some extended tags namely just the following first:-Publisher - shows record label, company or organization, was added to id3 v2 spec, also used in wma tags, flacogg and aac tags-Composer - who wrote the original song, even HTC sense music player supports this tag-Copyright - legal creators of the tracksong-Disc Number - of course for tracks on double-disc albums, even HTC sense music player supports this tag tooThere are many other extended tags that exist and that users, unassumingly, would discover in their tracks. For the many more extended tags Poweramps Info window could either display them all if in the track(s) (downwards scroll) or otherwise incoroporate a tabbed interface within the window to display the rest.You see above, I recommend any Windows users to try and play with a freeware app called mp3tag (www.mp3tag.deen) for which you can customize mp3tags interface to always display and edit these tags (I dont work for mp3tag Im just a fanboy).I also suggested that the Info window should be scrollable and thats scrollable downwards not sideways so that long text remains word-wrapped sideways within the size of the Info window.Many online purchase-music stores tag their tracks with these information and its lovely to have a player that can display this information.	tag,playlist,lyrics,flac

only play 4 #38; 5 star music as well as any unrated music	I have not seen this on any other player but it would be great to have a category, like beta 2 has most played rated etc, but only plays 4 amp; 5 star and unreated music. The reason I feel for including unrated music, along with 4 and 5 star music, is that everything will be played under this category until you choose not to like it. With players like media center is that if you choose your favourites then only the high star music gets played and any new music in the last 30 days. But if you have a large music collection then there is a chance you may not hear some of your new music within that 30 days and then the new music drops of the favourites category. The way I got around that is I open up media player and find all unrated music and make them 5 stars. That way they are still kept as a favourite for infinite time unless I choose they are not worthy of 5 stars But with 4 amp; 5 star music WITH UNRATED music then everything will be in the favourtites category until you actually choose you dont want to listen to it as a favourite.	playlist,search,shuffle,option
future android devices with cddvd players (maybe)	Hi, Think about it, If FFMPEG (which Poweramp uses) already supports CD-DA audio on Windowsall platforms and if there is probable FFMPEG library support for other quot;Discquot; audio formats on these Android OS hardwares like DVD audio then it might be good to make sure that Poweramp app supports proper playing back and handling of these files. Thik about Google TV and its Android app support.... Plus Google TVAndroid integrated into Blu Ray players like the Sony NSZ-GT1 Just a thought...	codec,tag,playlist,audio file

options for themes and colors	From using Poweramp for over a year now all I can say is that it needs more themes. I know pre-installed themes are scarce, but heres a few suggestions: * Allow users to create their own theme with quot;red, green and bluequot; presets and adjust the settings accordingly. * Release how you made the previous themes to users and allow them to make their own themes like keyboard themes on the market.	album art,widget,playlist,tag

queue improvements from 2.0 beta	Hey all, Have been rocking the 2.0beta for the last day or so and love what I see - two niggly things with the queue keep coming to mind: - Dont add duplicate tracks - would be nice if there was a menu option, or a setting to prevent duplicates from being queued. If a songs already queued up, dont add it again unless I want it added again ( handy for when adding playlists to the queue ) - Automatically remove a track from the queue once listened to. The queue seems to track the played tracks by marking them greydark, but would also be nice to maybe (setting?) remove a track from the queue once played. Mark	playlist,queue,play,library

control player via volume buttons	Dear Maxim Petrov, First of all thank you for the great work your doing! I really like Poweramp, but I also tested several other music players aswell. I think none of them features such a great audio quality as Poweramp does. This is the main reason why I decided for Poweramp. I nearly finished the 15-days-trial-version and now I consider buying Poweramp. But one feature I really miss is to skip tracks forward or backward via the volume buttons of my android device. This is a feature that my old SE Walkman phone had and that is also provided by several other music players for android devices like e.g. Winamp or PlayerPro. I think this is one essential feature to be implemented and I read in some forums that many users would like to see this being provided by Poweramp. Is it possible for you to implement this feature soon? Or do you even already plan to provide this feature with the coming update to version 2.0 this summer? Id really appreciate a positive answer from you Greetings martinxy	button,volume,playlist,version
playlist shuffle setting	I would really like to configure my playlist to set the shuffle setting when selected. For some playlists I like to play in order for others I prefer random. For example I like to have MovieBroadway lists play in order since they usually tell a story. Pink Floyd - The Wall comes to mind. I like my workout playlist to always play random. I also dont like the fact that if I have "shuffle all" set and then I select a playlist from a folder it doesnt play songs from the list but reverts back to the shuffle all after playing one playlist song. I always forget to change my setting to "shuffle folder" before I select my playlist folder and then I dont know why the wrong songs are playing. Drives me crazy.	playlist,--,04 apr 2011,folder

Im a big user of equalizer. As an audiophile I always tune my outputs sound to my preferred sound signature or to remove sibilance as much as possible. I could do so much more if Poweramp had more bands in their equalizer (like 20) or even changed it to a parametic equalizer (example electri q parametic equalizer) with unlimited equalizing potential. Thanks!	equalizer,version,option,album art
album artist support	Hello! Let me firstly say that i am very impressed about this app. As a foobar2000 user i am very happy to have found this technically great player for my new android phone. Great work! The only bad experience i have with Poweramp is that albums with different artists are cluttered in the artist view in library. So i would like to ask for album artist support. I think there are two possibilities to realize that support: a simple solution and a more enhanced one. The first one would just try to recognize if an album contains multiple artists and would group it then under "Various artists". Probably that would be a good solution for many users but for another part of the userbase that would mean that they will loose information saved to file. In many players for pc you can store the content for album artist. As all the players (Itunes, winamp, wmp, foobar2000, Helium music manager, Jriver MC, Media Monkey) go different ways it may be a bit tricky to satisfy all needs. I made some thoughts how the advanced support of album artist could look like and i think that three options could cover all possibilities: 1. "Use Itunescompilation flag". That is the option for our friends who use itunes. If that option is checked and there is no other album artist tag inside the file this flag is used to group different artist under one album. 2. Many player use an frame which is not predefined. In regard to how VorbisApe tags and ID3v2-TXXX (header) frames are written the frameheader name consists of natural language. I think it would be sufficient if Poweramp would use by default "album artist; albumartist" exactly in that order. I cant imagine that there are many people who would like to add a further name but who knows? 3. In regard to MP3s there is the defacto standard (WMP, itunes, Media monkey) that album artist is mapped to the TPE2 frame. An option for this mapping seems senseful as on one side this became a defacto standard but on the other side some player prefer the TXXX frame. (As i dont have wma or mp4 files i dont know how their frames for album artist is called but they must have one) Thanks for reading! I hope that you will adress the issue anyway! Many regards!	equalizer,all,repeat option,last played

some bugs and feature reqs majorly about embedded cue	Great!I cant stop to try the 430. So I installed it and tried at once.I think I dont need to say how good it is, go to try it yourself. Ill just report some bugs and have some feature requests here.The main menu (when you press menu button)s position can be wrong while putting status bar to the bottom (using CM7, etc.), this is a bug since 1.4I use monolithic flac to handle all things (cue, rg, art, etc.) and it works fine (but it seems Poweramp cannot handle front cover image 1MB?) except embedded cue.The cue-in-flac support in 2.0 is great, but I think something can be improved and tweaked:1. It seems that if the flac has an embedded cue, Poweramp cannot read album arts from it.2. Maybe expand the flac-cue file in which folder contains it (make the tracks in it the same level with other separated files, not treat it as a virtual folder ) can be more easy to understand and organize the playing list.3. I know its hard to delete some track from a cue-separated flac file, but modifying cue in it can be easy using libflac. Or maybe just add a feature called "hide" and handles which tracks should be play and which not by Poweramp itself.Thanks maxmpz, this one is really really great, and lets do together to improve it!	tag,embedded,cuesheet,lyrics

folder button, go to last used folder	It would be nice if the folder button could be changed or at least configured to bring the user back to the last used folder whenever the button is used from outside the folder view, while always bringing the user back to the defined root folder if clicked from inside the folder view. There are various situations, where the lack of this option is pretty annoying, e.g.:1. Open player2. Go to folder view, navigate to some subfolder x below your root folder3. Enqueue a couple of songs while remaining in folder view4. Hit the Library button to go to the library5. Go to queue6. Start first song while remaining in queue list7. Decide to add another track from the folder view8. Try to get back to subfolder x.The back button doesnt help in this case; neither does the folder button, which brings you back to the root folder.If the folder button would work in the suggested way, in step 8 you would just click it once to get back to the previously used folder and twice if you wanted to get back to the root folder. That would be much more comfortable than the current approach!Edit: I have suggested something similar before, but this new suggestion is a bit different, so I hope its not viewed as repostspam.	folder,playlist,library,button
notification cntrl, widget show playlist, playlist shortcuts	Poweramp is a great music player, there are however three main features i would really like to see before upgrading to paid version. Control from notification bar: Basically same controls as the 4x1 widget in the notification drop down so music can be changed without having to open player or go to home screen widget. Show playlist on widget: With the 4x1 player widget it would be great to flash the playlist name instead of songalbum for 0.5 - 1 second when you cycle using the and buttons so i can quickly see which playlist im switching to. Playlist shortcuts: It would be good to be able to put a shortcut to a playlist on the home screen, to quickly start playing my favourite playlists without having to go into the player. Implementing the suggestion above for showing playlist name on widget would be a good interim solution. Keep up the good work, you have a great effort here which is well on its way to being the best player on the market.	playlist,widget,button,folder
hide shuffle amp; repeat buttons	I think that a nice improvement to Poweramp would be to include an option in the menu to hide the Shuffle Repeat buttons as I keep setting them to ShuffleRepeat the current album, but then end up accidently pressing one of them and not noticing until a random song starts to play. After this happens a few times it begins to get very annoying! Cheers in advance and I hope developing 2.0 is coming along nicely, I cant wait until its release...	repeat,button,shuffle,segment a-b

However, on lighter backgrounds, the blue text with shadows is hard to read and doesnt look very well.

simple lockscreen widget request...

I got the idea from a ROM for my Incredible called Evervolv that when you use the Google Music player, it adds a widget with just the play#092;pause, previous song, next song buttons to the bottom of the lockscreen under the swipe bars. Its really subtle looking and doesnt clutter up the lockscreen. Just an idea...	lockscreen,widget,button,jeelybean

bluetooth headphones	Hi there,Id just like to make a request for a settings menu for bluetooth headphones. I have a pair of Sony DR-BT50 headphones which have a few controls on the left ear, heres a pic:At the moment,[folder +] and [folder -] = do nothing,[depressing the rocker] = playpause,[quick tap up on the rocker] = next song,[quick tap down on the rocker] = previous song,[long hold up on the rocker] = next album,[long hold down on the rocker] = previous album,and [volume updown] = just that.I would love to be able to customise this so that holding the rocker would skim through the current song, and the folder controls would flick through albums. I understand that there are a lot of different bluetooth headphones out there, and thats why a settings menu would be sweet! Thanks for considering the idea Poweramp people, I love the product already, this would just make it the shiz.Cheers	playlist,play,bluetooth,list
why you need an exit button	First, let me say that Ive been loving this app since the day I downloaded it. It may not be the prettiest, but the ability to customize it is simply unrivaled. I also love how it can pauseresume based on the headphone jacks state. ...This is also its undoing without an exit button. You know, one to completely kill the app. You see, I also use internet radio, specifically grooveshark and spotify, and I also love their android apps. Now, if I was using PoweAMP at any point since boot and had simply paused my music, when I go to plugin the headphones to listen to GroovesharkSpotify, Poweramp...resumes playback. I dont always want to stop the track, and sometimes I pause it, and by the time I come back forget I had a track playing before. This makes it really, really hard to use Poweramp without an exit button.	button,version,close,exit

But the only thing thats a little annoying is sometimes I like to listen to random music depending on my mood.. ie I might like to listen to songs from same artist so I will play one song then go back to library and pick another.. So what would be really cool is when you hit the folder library button it could return you to the last accessed folder or (artistalbum etc) category that you were previously in. As at the moment I have to press the folderlibrary button, then change it to library mode and then go through all the menus again to get to the same place.

At the volume I listen to with headphones, music is nearly inaudible over BT in my car, and once I realize why theres no sound, it can be tricky to safely change the volume. Also, as the action of the volume buttons on my Desire dont affect audio until something is playing, I have to make sure that Im not wearing headphones when I plug them in. Combined, it makes the v. useful auto start feature less usable.Cheers,Simon.	volume,button,bluetooth,option
state of the following feature requests?	The two following feature requests have been on the board for quite some time now; if I can remember correctly, probably since beta. Whats their current state and when can we expect them to be incorporated? "Listen To" support using Google Voice Search. I talked to Google directly on this one and they say it needs to be implemented by you, not them. There is a small line of code that needs to be added to each app that wants "Listen to" support. Apparently, its not that difficult to add according to Google. If added, users can hit the voice search button on their device and say "Listen to... [Artist, Song, Playlist, etc]" and it will launch a window with suggestions, then open up in Poweramp. Again, a small bit of code written by Google is required to be added to whatever app [in this case Poweramp] before it can take advantage of this feature. Visualizations This one is going to be more then a line or two of code, bug again, its been on the list for a long time. I really dont want to see it half-aed which is why I have not follow up on it when I asked months ago. It would be really nice to see this added, especially since a lot of phones can output to HDMI. At this point, I am kind of worried this feature request will turn out like the visualizations in iTunes, which are total crap. I remember using winamp 12 years ago in college and seeing some amazing visualizations plugins, that kind of quality would be nice. Hell, if you dont have the time to designed visualizations, can you make them plugin based and allow 3rd party people to make them? Thanks for the info.	control,playlist,tablet,car
crossfade suggestion	Hello. Im using Poweramp on my phone and Im very happy with it I have a suggestion about the crossfade function that Im sure is simple to implement and will make Poweramp the life of the party or atleast a radiostation that plays everything you want in your pocket The current (traditional) crossfade is to lower the volume of the track that ends, untill it reaches zero (fade-out), and, at the same time, raise the volume of the track that just starts from zero to the maxx (fade-in). While this feature is great and very useful, you could also add as additional (user-selectable) option for a crossfade WITHOUT fade-in and fade-out, just play the next track over the last track, when the fade time, selected by the user is reached. This will create the nice effect for DJ-like application that never stops playing, and, I think most users will like it. If no one has an idea what Im talking about, hear the next example:http:www.mediafire...u2nuxp2je5sa1iuNote the crossfade, between the songs, the next song plays without fade in over the current one, and the current one has no fade-out.	playlist,shuffle,crossfade,options
archos 5	I am looking for a better music player for my Archos 5, and picked-up an interesting review of your app. I need some information please from you I do not use the Archos as a phone, so I will not be able to download directly. Can I do so via my PC? I use the Archos as a media player through my high-end Hi-Fi. I do not download MP3s, all of my music files are full-format Windows Media Files ripped from my own CDs to retain full frequency-spread. All of these are synched regularly via my PC, together with playlists that I compile on the PC. Does your app sync with Windows Media Player? If answers to both the above are yes, are there any known issues regarding yor player and my methodology that I should be made aware of before purchasing? In answering that, please do not try and persuade me that what I am doing is not ideal - it works for me, I am quite happy with it, its just that the media player loaded on the Archos when I purchased it is not particulary good, and I wish to upgrade it.

automatic ratings	Would it be possible to count the number of plays a song gets and if it is played more than 13 through to increase rating or play count? If Im in my car and a song comes around that I am not in the mood for, Ill skip to the next song. If I like the song, Ill listen all the way through. Over time this would help me rank my songs and know which I can remove. For example if I rip a new CD with 10 songs and only 3 are good, I can use my mp3tag editor on the PC to sort by my rating (or number of complete plays) to decide which songs can be deleted from my SD card to free up space.

caching of embedded album art	The caching mechanism doesnt seem to process embedded album art. I have a few albums in which the mp3s contain relatively very large (640kb) embedded album art. Whenever a song of one of these albums is played, the player only responds to next or other commands after it is done loading and resizing the embedded image (which sometimes takes several seconds). I could, of course, reduce the sizes of the embedded images, but Im lazy :-) Also, perhaps a more compelling reason: it seems more efficient to use the (effective) caching mechanism for embedded album art instead of using cpu cycles for resizing the image every time a song with embedded art is played.	tag,album art,screen,display

feature request: smart shuffle	Hi, Love Poweramp and have used it exclusively since day 2 of owning my Samsung Galaxay i9000. So much better than the stock player and others available on the android market. I almost exclusively listen to my music on shuffle and its a constant annoyance of hearing the same band several times over without hearing anything from other bands that are included in the current shuffle mix Im listening to. Its not a exclusive Poweramp issue as Ive had the same complaint with ipods forever. Perhaps you could include a option to not replay the same artist band without playing a song from every other artist band first. Or at least not repeat songs from the same album until all other albums have had one song played. Thanks. CT	playlist,shuffle,artist,album

Apologies if this has already been requested or is in progress. Greatly appreciate your hard work, Poweramp is hands down the best app on my phone.	playlist,shuffle,crossfade,button

random album!	This is a fantastic program. Its sleek and beyond functional. I especially like that it supports gapless playback, which for some reason even the Winamp app just doesnt. The one missing feature is the ability to advance to a random album. Im actually surprised that its not available. MortPlayer (which is free) does this beautifully. Im even more surprised that it isnt included in the To Do list for Poweramp. Its the one thing thats keeping me from buying the program right away. (Im still thinking about it.) I tend to use my Android for listening to albums on long road trips so this feature would be very nice so I wouldnt be forced to listen to all my albums in order every time. If I knew for a fact that folder shuffling would be included in future update Id purchase the program right now and gladly wait.	playlist,bluetooth,button,option
sound effect please !	I bought Poweramp 2 months ago, and I also recommended my friends and family and in forum too. Many of them bought it too because Poweramp rocks !! But I always wanted Poweramp to add the feature that is should have long time ago, its the sound effect.. especially "Wide" effect Ive been using in my built in music player in Galaxy S for long time but its gone when I switched over to Poweramp. Oh it will be nice to allow Poweramp to use the 5.1 channel that it is in built in music player in Galaxy S too. Thats all	sound,srs,playlist,bluetooth
auto tagging and analyser	Hi Max, Please try for the auto tagging feature and the spectrum analyser feature. Also wanted to know if we can add lyrics directly from Poweramp or search for it.

artist folder from player	Is there a way to add an option to go to the artist folder of the song I am playing? There are many times that I shuffle my music, and upon hearing a particular artist, I get in the mood to listen to that artists music. To do so, I am required to navigate through the menus. While only a minor nuisance, it would be nice if there were a button added or a gesture that would perform this task.	playlist,artist,folder,library
equilizer for each song...	Hi, i would love the following: Well, each song needs an individual equilizer setting for perfect sound. So what do you think to give us the option to safe setting to each song? i.e. When i set up the EQ while a song is playing ther could be a save option "safe to actual song" and PA could write a smal eq-info-file into the song folder. Next time the song is playing this file could be read out by PA. Greetings from Germany Fokus	playlist,screen,option,search

search on artistalbumsong while playing.	Someone else described this and its a feature Id like to see implemented. Another music player had it implemented in a way that I thought worked very well. With this music player when you pressed on the current playing info section youd get a popup. It was context sensitive and had 3 options. Search on Current Artist, Search on Current Track, Search on Current Album. Hitting the specific option would fire off the search. Would make it easy to find remixes of a current song, the rest of the album or even all songs made by that artist. Loving Poweramp BTW. Heads and toes above the other Android music players.	search,playlist,album art,artist

store current random playlist for next use	I have a giant folder of songs which I select to shuffle and listen to while out and about. When I go back into power amp, the current song is the last one I was listening to, but it says it is track 1 of however many are in the folder even though I had already listened to 30 tracks. As I keep listening, I often find the next random tracks are ones I heard in my previous session. It would be awesome if power amp wrote that shuffled playlist to memory and recalled its progress on next load. This would allow me to eventually listen to each song in that shuffle list once over numerous sessions provided I only hit play when restarting the program and not choosing something new to listen to.

listlog of last songs played	Hi everybody, I give you an idea for a new feature: it would be great if the program logged all the song playedskipped, giving the possibility to know the title of songs listened even hours or days after you listen them. I use my mp3 reader driving my car, and many times I felt the need to know the title of one of the songs I listened to in the last hour, even if I couldnt look at the display during the playback. The log should be similar to this: June 18 2010: Time 08.33.40: Nirvana - "Lithium" Time 08.37.25: Take That - "Back for good" (skipped) Time 08.38.00: Peral Jam - "Alive" June 17 2010: ... And so on. Of course should be possible to limit log to X days before today, or to delete it etc etc. Someone think this option can be useful? Thanks in advance!

This is the current playlist which will be played and then the player stops. i can search throughout my whole collection with the search bar and look for certain songs or albums. i can either start one song of the new result list und i have a new "now playing" list, the old one is gone. or i can choose "play next" and the results will be added to the current "now playing" list. how can i archieve this wis Poweramp? in Poweramp i can add a folder or an album and start playing. but i dont have a "now playing" list? however, after finishing the album the player starts playning random music? how can i quickly add a song to the now playing list when i have 3000 songs and severeal folders on my sd? for example: i am listening to album abc in folder abc. now i feel like to listen to one certain song called zyx in folder zyx, but after this song i want the player to continue to play album abc. when using the search button, i cannot search the whole library. i have to go to the library, select all songs, hit the search button, enter song name, and then what? in media monkey i select play next and the song is next in my "now playing" list. or i am listening to a folder with 500 tracks. i am listening to song a and song b is next. now i feel like listening to song z but i want to continue with b after z. possible? 2) When using folders i would like the option to open a folder including all subfolders! 3) using genre: i checked and double checked: i tagged all my songs with the genre "electro".

volume reset function	First off, thank you for an incredible music player! Its by far the best. Ive been using it almost every day on my HTC Desire for about 6 months. My suggestionrequest: I use my phone both with headphones and connected to my stereo. When I connect it to the stereo I want the volume to be set to maximum. When Im using headphones, however, I do not want to have the volume set to max of obvious reasons. The auto-resume playback feature when a jack is inserted is awesome, but it doesnt recognize if Im plugging in my stero or headphones(of course), so I have to open Poweramp and manually adjustcheck the volume in fear of getting my brains blown out before I plug in my headphones. This kind of eliminates the advantage of the auto-resume feature and could be fixed with an option that lets you set a default volume level that is used every time a jack is inserted and prevents any uncomfortable accidents! Hope this is clear and understandable, if not, please comment! Thanks again, and keep up the good work! Sindre	volume,option,button,screen

back button	Currently when back button is pressed while player is on screen it exits the player. What it should do is go back to the cd, and then to the library. It is quite counter productive to have the home button and back button do the exact same thing. So hopefully this was already planned for 2.0, if not, please look into it. It would make navigation much much better. -Nestor	button,screen,library,folder

It would be much better to make back take you to the album, and then the library or something, not exit the app. Right now the back button is the same as the home button because power amp does not close when exited unless not playing.

switch audio to bluetooth	I have an HTC Evo 4G with Android 2.3.3. Most of the day I am using a Motorola Oasis HX520 (one ear unit).When I had a blackberry there was a software switch with something like "speaker to bluetooth" or "sound to bluetooth". I could listen to my music or podcasts in the mono earpiece while working hands free and still receive calls. 8-) I think there was a switch in Slacker Radio that did this too but it could have os specific -dont remember.I can not do this with my current phone and Power Amp. I did notice that when I press my earpiece button for a call it connects to the phone and I can hear Power Amp!

default music app	Power Amp cannot be made to be the default music app in 2.3.4. As a result, you cannot do a search from the Google Search Widget on Power Amp.

I know already that song info can be viewed in the info screen but this is not what I mean. If Poweramp could have a Lyrics feature then surely this feature idea should deserve the same attention too.For example, If the ability existed, I could replace the text of folder directory and in its place choose a metadata tag to display instead and it would display (if its in the file). So if the composer tag was in the file of my mp3s and flacs and I set the composer tag as a custom display tag, then I would want that text to display as "Composer: Blah Blah" without the quotes in that same song text area.Same for any or all tags, they would display with the prefix of a colon ":"Composer:Publisher:Copyright:Encoded by:Band:......

3 feature requests + 1 possible bug	First off I must say that Poweramp is by FAR the most advanced, thoroughly updated app available on the Market in its class. I used it for the first time yesterday evening and was absolutely elated. I have a few feature requests that I believe may improve the apps usability: 1. Downloaded album art should be available to be saved directly to the id3 tag file. Additionally, more id3 tag editing functionality would be very nice indeed. 2. Playpause and track forwardback buttons should be added to system pull-down menu. (presently, users may only open the app when the Android pull-down menu is visible instead of control the music being played.) 3. BATCH OPERATIONS: similar to the iPod Touch and the iPhone music players, this feature would allow the manipulation of more than one file at a time or less than a whole group of files at a time rather than only being able to, for example, add one file at a time to a playlist, or an entire folder or search results. These batch operations would be a simple check-box interface and could be used for deletions, playlist creation, moving music from folder to folder, etc. Were these features added, I would have no problem paying twice as much for this app! (: Now for the one bug I found that may be a local problem on my device: I am running Froyo (2.2.1) on my Verizon Samsung Fascinate. In the "Lock Screen Options" settings menu, I cant seem to get the "Direct Unlock" option to work right for me (even after reloading the application, rebooting my device, and some other troubleshooting). I would love to unlock directly to the home screen, but every time my device is lock and I attempt unlocking, I have to go through the system unlock even though the "Direct Unlock" setting is checked. Is this something that other users are having trouble with too? I think this is a great feature that would definitely put the app ahead of others, but it seems to work the same as the rest.	equalizer,all,repeat option,last played
list of suggestions from a new user	Sorry if some of these have been mentioned already :oops: 1. Im not sure of the reason (maybe someone can explain) but when entering playlists, it has to load which can take a few seconds, can playlists be cashed for faster access? 2. Show the currently playing playlist on the player screen so we know which playlist were on While flicking between them using gestures on the album art. 3. Maybe add the option to show Song info on the player screen. (year, track, genre, composer 8-) ) I would especially like the year to be shown. 4. The addition of a "now playing" screen that can be reordered. Example: if 60s rock playlist is playing, it will show that playlist in the now playing screen and can be reordered without reordering the actual playlist, and make it so that the now playing screen can be saved as a playlist. (look at player pro as a better example) 5. Make it so that a single tap on the album art both opens and closes the lyrics screen, rather than having to tap the little "X" to close, which can be tedious. 6. Make it an option to use the volume rockers long press as previousnext buttons, also with the option of using the volume buttons to "wake" the phone. 7. Add ratings. 8. Add composer to the library screen. 9. Allow customization of the lock screen "unlock" button. I much prefere a slider over a button. 10. Not sure if its a bug, but Poweramp has added content from my ringtone folder even though the folder isnt selected in the options. Excellent player BTW, keep up the good work.	playlist,lock screen,screen,search
flac sorting and library	I would like to see the Library recognize all file types or at least have the option to sort by track # in Folder view. For me I have albums of FLAC files that dont show up in the Library, only in "Folders".

quot;list item click actionquot; addition	Could you consider adding an additional action to the "List Item Click Action" menu? I would like to see an option to bring up the long press menu by a single tap. This would prevent interrupting a playlist by accidentally tapping a song when browsing, you could choose to cancel the action or select one of the long press menu options. This would make passing around a phone at parties to let other people en-queue a song much easier, people in various stages of inebriation cant seem to help tapping a song by accident. Even sober people do it far too often. Cheers.	library,option,folder,list

tap screen to pause	I think it would be great to have the ability to simply tap the screen (or at least the lock screen) to pause a song. I love the ability to use gestures to skip tracks on the locked screen; it makes it a very car-friendly music player and is why Im considering purchasing it. However, when I need to pause a song I have to tap where I think the pause button is going to be, or I have to look at the screen - something I want to avoid while driving. Or, another possibility is to shake the player in order to pause. I like whatever is eyes free.	screen,lock screen,widget,volume
higher volume	(Maybe this can be solved on my phone directly with some hack, but...) It would be great to be able to turn up the volume much more. I did set the reply gain to 89db (with Media Monkey) so I have not to change volume constantly. But on my phone (HTC Desire Z) the music plays really quit on my headphones. I have set the "preamp" in Poweramp to the max (and volume too) and still its not loud enough (and I am not talking about ear killing madness! - riding in the subway is often more loud than my music with really good headphones ). Is there any solution for me? Would a higher preamp make sense? Cheers Joachim	volume,button,screen,option

modular widgets for tabs	it would be nice to have a widgets with the following: only Album art (eg just a picture frame that show the album art), preferably resizeable with various launchers. control buttons eg. large playpause button, prev and next. would be nice to have them as resizeable with different launchers. I know there already buttons like this but something Built for power amp would be nice. separate volume widget and effects widget. Basicly I have a Galaxy 7" Tab that spends part of its life as an in care player. the above widgets would allow for layouts across multiple screens. EG. player controls and album art on one screen and EQ sliders on another. Larger play and pause buttons for easer in car access and general use. ps, i love the App very good and well worth the money paid for it removes the need to run from with in the app wile driving.	widget,album art,screen,button
formats	Ok, Poweramp rocks. Ive been wanting a good flac player with features of a Mp3 player. Tried Poweramp a while back but moved on. Retried and the updates were phenomenal. Bought it, bought 32 gb card for EVO. Play only flac files. Anyways, will there be any additional formats codecs in the future? I would really like a dts wav quad sound capability. I do not even know if it would-be possible. EVO might only have stereo out. But do not know limitations of Bluetooth. I use Poweramp primarily on my commute to work. Will be upgrading my head unit in my truck soon. Will have to just use cds for surround sound. Great app. Thanks!	sound,windows,bluetooth,video

stop after 1-play and quick playlist	Pretty simple.Stop after 1-Play featureWhat: A play-option in the REPEAT section, that stops playback after the current song finishes. i.e. noncontinuous play i.e. prevents playing the next songWhy: Often I like to listen to just one song on my phone, just once, and Id love not having to open up my phone each time and hit the pause button after a song finishesHow: First two are already in there, the third is what should be includedRepeat all songsRepeat current songNon-continuous playQuick playlistA feature to allow marking of songs and then adding those marked songs to a playlist.

feature request: google music support (ifwhen possible)	May be a longshot, and may not even be possible, but once Google music is ubiquituous, it would be cool if we could access our music stored on our Google music account via Poweramp. Im not sure if Google is going to make that possible, but I dont want to listen through the lame Google Music app. I want my cloud of 20k songs accessible through Poweramp. Im just saying that if they make the ability for other players to access a users Google Music account (via a google account permission), it should be a priority to add this feature.	playlist,help,buy,google music
folder management - exclude, include, clear cache	I dont know exactly how Poweramp interfaces with folders and how it keeps track of them. That said... I AM aware that you can select folders in the program, etc. The problem is... There are certain folders that I DE-SELECT from that very list...and I subsequently rescan...that Poweramp still accesses in the playlist. I do not WANT this folder in the playlist but it still plays files from this folder. Its a folder of ringers that Ive made for my phone. I dont want them in my list when I go SHUFFLE ALL in Poweramp. The folder has been checked, unchecked, rechecked, unchecked again...and it still plays my ringers during shuffle mode. Can we get some clarification on how Poweramp handles folders? Or EVEN BETTER... "Exclude" specific folders.	folder,playlist,setting,library
short rewind on resume on bt connect.	I have been using Poweramp for a few weeks now and it does much more than I need, thank you very much. One of the places I use it is in the car connected to the stereo through bluetooth. In that mode it starts and stops the audio playback depending on if BT in the car is active or not. That works great but because of connection lag the player starts a few seconds before the audio is actually switched on the stereo. And similarly when the car and BT are shut off, the player is still running until the phone recognizes BT has gone away. This causes a several second gap of audio content. Not good for podcasts or audio books. These connection lags are inherent in most BT connections so a small change to your program can help out us podcastaudio book listeners. Put a setting in to back up the player 5 or ten seconds on BT resume. You could even have the rewind amount be user settable. This is also good for podcasts and audio books to refresh where you were the last time you where listening to the audio. Just my 2 cents. Great program!	bluetooth,option,playback,tag
full-screen coverart	Thanks for a great app! One feature that would be really great to have is the ability to show album cover-art full screen (perhaps with startstopbackforward buttons that could be shown overlaid when pressing the screen while in full-screen mode). This would be amazing for presenting audio tracks with individual coverart, and would be a great visual effect overall. Really hope this can be implemented in an upcoming version! Thanks, - Pete	button,playlist,screen,album art
merge folder view and library view together	I think current folder view is too complicated to use: the songs in folder view could only be add to folder playlist, and if you choose a parent folder to play, you can see the songs in only one child folder at the same time. I hope the folder view could be parallel with artist, album or genre v. iew and in the library .then the songs in folder view and artist view could be add to same playlist. And in library, instead of just show the name of different views(artist,album,etc),also display their contents. You can take playerpro, another player on android as a reference. and i want the contents dynamic queue could be changed automatically. For example, if i choose a parent folder to play the contents of the dynamic queue will be all the songs in this folder,sorted by their paths. All what i said is very common in other mobile players. There is no need to be different that users cannot accustom to it.	folder,library,playlist,view
playlist shortcut support?	Hello, One of the most important features, for me, is playlist shortcut support, so I can start listening my playlists without having to enter the player and search for that playlist.

poweramp overriding headset control while not being used	Firstly, I really like your program. Miles ahead of any other music player Ive tried (Ive tried a lot) Except for the widget skins (which I know are coming later) the one problem I have is with the headset resume. Is there any way that it wont override whatever is currently playing? Sometimes Im listening to podcasts through google listen, and I want to plug it into my car. But I have to pause it, go to Poweramp, pause the music in Poweramp and then return back to the other program to continue the podcast. ts really convenient thought whenever I just want to put on some music and just plug it in. But I wonder if theres a way to tell Poweramp to hold off whenever Im doing something else?	volume,button,screen,control

constant dynamic folder scanning (w custom delay)	Support for minute-by-minute auto-background scanning for missing files within folders - this solution should make sure of avoding that awful failed to play error for files recently removed from my sd card. Addtionally next to this a custom delay time e.g scan ever 30 secs, 1 mins, 5 mins etc Scanning within this feature, if implemented, should not be harsh but likely relaxed (if that makes sense) which should be better for cpu usageless strain on sd card. Just being thoughtful there, thank you.	playlist,library,folder,bluetooth

asus transformer microsd	Im a new Poweramp user and was trying to set up my music folders on my new ASUS Transformer tablet. The Transformer uses EMMC storage, either 16 or 32GB and its located at mntsdcardxxxx . Theres also a slot for a micro sd card. Its address from system root is RemovableMicroSDxxxx. At this point I cant get to any music on the MicroSD since settings only allows me to get to mntsdcard. Could you add RemovableMicroSDxxxx to your list of folders? Ive also noticed threads for other tablets with different folder names. Im wondering if implementing a browse function to point to whatever folder the user wants might be simpler than you having to keep track of many different folder naming conventions.

google voice actions	I think Ive tested every music player on the app store and like Poweramp over all the others but I seldom use it. Since most of my music listening is done in the car I need to be able to use Google Voice Commands. This has pretty much forced me to use either WinAmp or CarTunes combined with the CM7 DSP Manager and a separate scripting app. Ive spoken with other CM7 users who also prefer Poweramp but never use it for the same reasons. Is it possible to customize Poweramp to use Google Voice Commands? Also, why cant Poweramp have buttons to run the CM7 DSP scripts? These scripts can also be used in HTC Sense but the numbers are different. snd3254 –dspmode 00. DualMicPhone 01. DualMicPhoneEP 02. DualMicPhoneSPK 03.

replay gain	Hi!ReplayGain like its implemented in foobar2000. PreAmps can be set for tracks with and without RG-Info independently.This way the Volume difference between tracks with and tracks without RG-Info can be minimized.[attachment=1]foobar.preamps.png[attachment]Furthermore a smart selection of replay gain source would be nice. By smart I mean using track gain when listening to random playlists or shuffling over your entire music library and using album gain when listening to a single album.[attachment=0]replaygain-override.png[attachment]Thanks and keep up the excellent work!	screen,play,replay,sound check

shuffle, but keep some tracks together	Never seen a player that could do this, but with classical music in particular the tracks are often divided at places you wouldnt really want to start playing randomly. Id love to be able to select a group of tracks in an album and say "keep these together in this order", then if Im playing randomly shuffled songs and it picks one of the tracks in a "keep together" group, then it will play all those tracks together in the proper order before going off to randomly play something else at the end of those tracks.	playlist,artist,option,album
allow a default setting for sorting library playlists	Im not a big user of many different audio file-types...just itunes stuff mostly, so I am using Library rather than Folder view. Anytime I import a playlist and then view it using Power AMP, I have to manually select how the playlist is sorted the first time I open it, and then only that playlist defaults to that sort when I open it again. I noticed in settings that you have a lot of power over how folders in folder view are sorted. It would be nice to have a default setting that would allow the user to select how playlists will be sorted by default. Also, while in a playlist, it would be nice to have a sort button right on the screen allowing you to toggle through different sorting options without leaving the playlist (eg press the button once, and the playlist is sorted by artist name. press again and it is sorted by song name etc.) All in all though, my compliments on a great app...head and shoulders above any other player ive used, and well worth the purchase price. Thanks!	playlist,library,sort,folder

dynamic normalization	There are some stand alone music players out there, like most Samsung and Sony players, which have a function that automatically adjusts the volume to make the music play at the same volume, it is called dynamic normalization. Some music files sound softer than others depending on the equipment used to record the music, like music recorded on digital equipment may sound louder than music which is recorded on analog sources like tapes, thats where normalization comes in, it also enables soft parts of a song to play at the same volume as the rest of the song. I think that this might be a nice add on to the next version.	sound check,normalization,volume,equalizer
poll hardware controls	It would be nice to use the volume rocker, the same way you can use it in idle mode to turn up or down the volume, to use it to skip to the next track or the previews one by holding it down for 3 seconds (i.e.) I remember my old SE phone having this feature, and I really miss it. It is a great player, but in my opinion it’s missing this very simple but useful feature to not have to depend on the touch screen while driving.	volume,button,screen,hardware

But, it taken so many time and hdd.. ;; As Poweramp announced that lot of new fuction are supported at version 2.0, I hope supporting AIFF files to be included at version.20 update..

bluetooth onoff - instead of exit	Im using Poweramp for my music and Doggcatcher for my podcasts and both products work well for what they do and keep me company for the 6 hours a day that I spend in my car. My one complaint though is that they dont play nicely with each other with my Motorola T505 hands-free bluetooth unit. Once I start Poweramp it stays resident on the phone (No - even though an "exit" option would be nice Ive already read the answer to that). If I then start DoggCatcher and press the "pause" button on my Bluetooth unit, PowerAmpt treats it as a request to start playing again even though I wanted DoggCatcher to pick up the request. DoggCatcher has an "exit" option which keeps it from interfering when I just want music so going from podcasts to music works fine. Its the other way around thats the problem. What Id like to suggest is some "master setting" switch that turns onoff Poweramps listening for Bluetooth to give the other app a chance to be controlled. Ideally a big enough button so my fat fingers can hit it without diving through all sorts of menu options. In a perfect world, Poweramp would "know" that theres a Bluetooth device connected and ask upon startup - or when the interface is re-activated if I wanted to connect or not to make it convenient to turn on. For me, this gets around the whole "exit" question - not that I wouldnt like that too - but Ive read the answers on that ... . Thanks for a great product. APB	bluetooth,button,close,exit
shuffle folders	Dear developers, it would be great to have an additional shuffle mode: "Shuffle Folders". Effect of this mode would be: - songs in a folder would be played in original sequence - after playing last song in the folder, next folder would be selected randomly Usually I listen to music in my car. I like to listen to albums as they are, keeping the original sequence of songs, but I would like to listen to randomly selected albums. In this case I wouldnt have to listen always "Bon Jovi" after "AC DC". :-) Thank you for your help. Regards, Kaci	playlist,folder,shuffle,library

ideas amp; suggestions for future skin making in poweramp	IdeasSuggestions for future Skin making in Poweramp1.) Support for skin makers to be able to use a wait screentransition screen. E.g. in between moving between different screens of PA like from player screen to EQ screen. Use of wait-like animated cursor icons etc2.) Support for imaging Overlays over the album art area (both in player and in widget). I think this would already exist. Basically I, if making skins in future, would like to be able to use transparent PNG images over the album art area to give that enclosed effect of a particular skin e.g. like this transparent case rotated CD case effect(click on image to enlarge)3.) Support for 3D skins. On the android homescreen LauncherPro app, there is 3D option when transition in between screens. Now what if this same 3D look could be fixed, I am talking about a future 3d PA skin that could have all the text,album art graphics in a fixed 3d state like this;a 3D button control skin;other 3D skin create-able examples;-a spinning CD Disc (animated fast-spinning) on a skin -how cool!!-a 3D opened box case skin w 3d placed text4.) Support for visual effects in skins e.g. Flash, Open GL, APNG (animated png) - might require additional low-level Android native coding.5.) Support for customizable and any-placeable metadata ID Tags texts (any tags). Basically it would be nice in special skins to be able to access tags such as composer or disc number and display them directly on the player - along with custom fonts, text size, color, text gradient effects. e.g. a jukebox skin or a totally less-graphical text based skin think of some of foobar2000s skins. ...for making a cassette tape skin like this and use this metadata info in a custom font for a skin;6.) Support for a touchdragg-able cursor for skinning (just like on Windows OS). Basically if I as a prospective skin maker wanted to make a Vista themed skin for PA, it would also be cool if there was an ability to have a cursor on finger movement around the screen and too cursor waiting. Just as an option.7.) Support for multi-display album art on a skin. Latest PA(Poweramp) versions already can access multiple album art that is embedded within tracks or is in folder of tracks which is excellent. So that access ability is there, but for skin makers it should be there too in order to make some rather interesting skins.e.g. a dual-album art skin (front+back cover at the same time) - KD Player (java j2me app);Or perhaps also front cover ON TOP of the back cover, like this;(if no back cover available then of course empty or something in its place)8.) Support for 1080p compatible skins (1920x1080p) as ever emerging Android devices, smartphones (e.g. Samsung Galaxy S2, tablets etc) have HDMI output function which means familybusiness users can output there whole Android onto a big screen. Maybe support for skin making with the use of scalable Vector formats like (.svg skins if Android supports that). 9) VLC has some awesome skins which I or original skin makers could convert to use on PA as a skin; http:www.videolan.orgvlcskins.php - Also KM Player, WinAmp, AIMP and Spider Player have awesome looking skins too. These are all desktop originated- Windows OS media players. But that should not deter anyone (with permission), or even original skin maker themselves, from converting these skins for use on PA(Poweramp) as a skin.10.) Consider adding API support for Flash (Adobe Flash) based skins which could even supplement some of the advanced previous skins ideasrequests made above 11.) Changing color of native Android OS UI color scheme of Black to White or another color. I am talking about for when most Android apps, such as PA itself, give user access to app settings. I know it is possible to change that to white such as this;Skin option in a meta file for this would be awesome too.12.) Poweramp could even have a special Theme Zone which would be its own little market app where users can download apply skins (internet required) right within PA itself. Think of the skin makersdesigners out there that would want to invest in PA a little more and make super high-end quality skins and may want to charge a fee for these skins too - thats where you could step in, Max, and become a paid mini-Android market yourself and it wont just be for skins, but for PA extensions, addons, DSP packs etc that users would make too etc :ugeek: 13.) Support for scrolling text (tags etc) in the skins and advanced text effects such as text dancing, text fade inout between tracks, text jump inout with speed settings per-configured by skin maker or maybe even user-configurable14.) Album art effects, ground-breaking effects ideas. Even a skin idea I have recently of Album art that would present itself as broken glass;15.) Ability to totally re-skin the EQ screen, volume knobs and everything in that screen.16.) Support for indicators. I mean text-based codes that a skin maker can use for hisher skin to show to users if say Equalizer is enabled or if Bass or Treble is on . This would be if I were to make a skin theme of a "Sub-Woofer" or "Hi-Fi player" and wanted a way of letting skin users know that EQ was enabled etc17.) Support for on-player visualizations (e.g. most notably Spectrum). I hope not too complex. I am mostly getting at a mini-Spectrum that could sit somewhere on the skin e.g. below album art. I have seen it in foobar2000s default GUI and some other media players and its not like a fully blown fullscreen visualization (as is already lined up in PAs TODO list). Active mini-Spectrum (or other Vizs) on a skin like on these skins;http:t2.pixhost.orgthumbs236169635682011-04-30163819.pngThese are all things to think of for the far future ahead in possibilities of skinning Poweramp.

folder scan - option for timed scan amp; select cifs subfolder	Hi - excellent app A couple of requests comments I use it on my tablet (Advent Vega) and access all my media via CIFS on my NAS box. Being NAS, it takes quite a while to rescan the CIFS folder and although my music collection doesnt change that often, Id like to have a timed scan automatically once a week. I can force a re-scan but this means a delay before using the app so Id like the option to have Poweramp initiate a background scan at a specified time (e.g. Friday 10am) Second request is about CIFS. I create my mount point using CIFSManager and it currently maps my mount point to the root of my NAS as that is all it is able to do. As a result, when I scan the folder, it scans ALL the folders on NAS (#092;#092;openshare#092;*) rather that just the folder where I have my music (#092;#092;openshare#092;Music#092;*). Is it possible to select a subfolder in Poweramp ? [MortPlayer has this capability but isnt as good in other areas] Thanks in advance.	library,play,network,nas
stop at startend of the listqueueselection	Hello, Ive just purchased the program and its great, but what realy annoys me is that - I pick f.ex. from library one artist and select "play all", first song of the list starts to play and when I click previous it jumps to some songs I never selected which are taken from whole library. I would realy appriciate if I can choose somewhere in settings, that when theres queue or I selected play all - I will only loop through files of the queue or my selection - think this is standart player behavior and I would realy like that option. I dont like making playlists or something - I usally select Artist and play whole discography or just one album. And I would like all gestures and buttons let me move only i my selected range ... For example if I have several albums from one Artist would jump from album to album and from song to song ... The selection would cycle if theres repeat all option, and do nothing on startend of the songs if it isnt. I hope you understand what I mean and such possibility would realy make your program 100 for me. Thanx Uli P.S.: I hope I didnt miss something in settings what is already there ...	playlist,artist,library,button
disable whole id3 tags	hi there,ive just bought this app and kink of like this. but im missing one feature.disabling the tags.im not a music storing personal and have like only 800 songs, which are not-ill-tagged.about 600 are are sorted by folder tree with artist first and album later. rest 200 are songs from various artists and stored in a single MISC folder because its useless make whole artistalbum tree for only 1,2 files. these 200 files are named in artist - title.mp3by this, i can repeat every song from an artist or repeat only single album, or make a new playlist based on an artist. and ive never had needs of genre sorting system, so there are no use of id3 tags for me-it only makes me annoying. and here the problem happens.when i open MISC folder then i can see a whole mess. some of them are showing their tag based titles, and some of them are showing artist-title.mp3 with unknown artist. why i cannot see just filenames only and make the screen neat and tidy? my files are already sorted by artist, and album, and if they are not, that means all information i care are on the filenames(artist + title). would you please make an option disabling WHOLE id3 tagging system?	tag,artist,sort,library

All of my unsplitted .flacs .apes have .cue embedded in them and right now always plays as one big track and this is one Poweramp flaw that I can think of right now.

I would like to choose after playing a complete folder what the player has to do: a) stop and go back to the first track of this folder or stop and go to the first track of the next folder c) play the first track od this folder (normal repeat) - existing d) play the frst track of the next folder (current function) - existing 2. when Poweramp plays i would like to choose, if the player can deactivate the original lockscreen or not (current). so not like current power amp shows a widget - its better to decativate the lockscreen completely and show the whole player, not only a widget. Is it possible?	folder,lockscreen,playlist,widget

video support galaxy s feature support	Hi folks, the awesomeness of Poweramp is beyond discussion now. 1. I am ready to pay another 4.99 to be able to play videos in Poweramp. The important factor is to be able to play videos not natively supported by the handset - example DivX on HTC desire HD. Currently an SD DivX content is reeeeealy bad in HTC desire HD, and the available players are nothing but garbage. If you can pull this off the way that youve created current Poweramp, I am ready to pay another 4.99 2. Another features Id fancy having is the sound effects support in Samsung Galaxy S handsets, including virtual 5.1 surround sound support. Cheers and the best to you. Signature - an avid fan of your work.	sound,windows,video,version

pauseplay previousnext music track on notification bar	Hello there, I just came across a pretty good idea. I love the player and I dont think it could be any better. Its the best on android! I was just thinking that it would bbe pretty cool to have the play, pause, previous track and next track button on the notification bar along with the song whenever u pull down the notification bar. Its quick and very convient and best of all, new to everyone else. So Poweramp would be the first player on android to have the feature. But I hope you like my idea and it brings u more fortune in the success of the music player Sincerely Anthony Asher	bbe,button,volume,screen

hide artistalbum	Hey there, Ill make this quick. I found that I have quite a few artists with only one song in my library. I cant be the only one, so I have a feeling others are also bothered by scrolling through a library populated heavily by single song artists to get to artists that the user would actually use the sorting feature to find. Basically, I dont think anyone goes through the sort by artist section to find one song. Could there be a way to hide certain artists, or even albums, from that view to reduce the clutter, but keep the song? The song would probably only be played through the All Songs listing anyway. Maybe even a function that automatically hides an artist or album if it doesnt reach a lower limit of X songs? Im sorry if Im not clear enough, its a little hard to explain it.	library,artist,playlist,sort
sort albums by artist, then year, and auto-advance	Hey, this might be somewhat of a niche feature, but Id like to see albums sorted by artist, then year in the Library view. 3 (cubed) does this, and I thought it was a pretty neat idea, especially combined with auto-advance. Sorting music this way allows you to listen to an artists discography in chronological order, if youre in the mood to just listen to an entire artists discography. If this is implemented, Id probably pay any price for this app. Well, maybe not 20+, but it would still be a feature that Id love. Thanks for reading.	artist,playlist,sort,library

don#39;t list top level folder	Hi, I have a suggestion for a change in Poweramp folder hierarchy. When you check one or more music folders in the respective menu all of these folders are displayed as top level folders in the folders tab hierarchy. This probably feels OK when you use multiple folders however many users including me only use a single top level folder for storing their music. In this scenario only on top level folder is displayed and it becomes an unnecessary nuisance to navigate into this folder before you can see the actual list of albums in that folder. Could you please add the option NOT to display the top level folder(s) in the folders hierarchy and only show the sub-folders? Thanks Petr	folder,play,library,list

longer seek bar (at least in landscape mode)	The ability to seek through a song quite useful when there are parts you likedont like, but especially for things like audio books, recorded lectures, etc. The seek bars accuracy as of now is not very good, mostly because its so short and fixed to one length. The longer the audio track, the harder it is to seek to a desired location accurately. It would be helpful if there were an option to extend the seek bars length, at least in landscape mode. But what would REALLY be cool, is if the seek bar could do the following: -zoomable, that is, the ability to use multitouch to zoom in or pinch to zoom out -scrollable, after zooming in, the ability to swipe it back or forth -able to select a discrete time index. Maybe double-tap and hold the seek bar to show a toast of the time index thats being touched, then sliding your finger back or forward will move through the seek bar as the toast updates the time index. When you let go, playback is moved to that time index. If the seek bar happens to be zoomed-in, then sliding your finger back or forward will auto-scroll the seek bar. The speed at which it auto-scrolls would be determined by how far left or right your finger is. -able to save bookmarks within individual tracks. Unlimited startstop marks. For example: Say my song is 4 minutes long, and I want to always skip the 3rd minute. I would set a Start-marker at 0:00:00, a stop-marker at 0:02:00, and another start-marker at 0:03:00. Anything from a start-marker to a stop-marker (or EOF) would play, anything from a stop-marker to a start-marker (or EOF) would be skipped. You could put as many startstops in a track as you want. Also, the option to transition from a stop to the next start with a subtle "gradient effect" would make it sound more natural, instead of an abrupt change in audio. -the option to have a vertical seek bar. That way the seek bar could be as long as possible when in portrait mode. I know thats a tall order. But holy cow that would be SOOOOOOO COOL!!	equalizer,all,repeat option,last played

option to toggle off notification sound music interruption?	Maxmpz,I see that you already commented on this idea at least once in the past, such as this post:But what Im wondering is whether or not itd be possible for you to implement a hack of sorts to allow this to be toggled off—some way to trick the OS into behaving differently. Ive read that the other major smartphone operating systems merely fade the music low in volume during a notification, while Androids 2-second mute is quite abrupt to the listener. I dont expect something as elegant as a volume fade to be easily implemented, but if notifications could be played simultaneously with music, even at the same volume, I think a lot of users would be pleased. It sure doesnt seem like Google will be addressing this in the OS any time soon: http:code.google.c...detail?id=5012Any thoughts? Keep up the awesome work! :mrgreen: Jon	volume,button,playlist,option

When I press the home screen playlist shortcut, the playlist opens in the stock Android music player, not in Poweramp.

shuffled playlist	Cant see this in the current features to do list, but apologies if it is there. Recently started using this rather than PocketPlayer on win6.5, which was excellent. The feature I miss most is being able to create a playlist of my entire collection and then shuffle that list so that each song would only play once throughout playing through that list. It would then remember your position from day to day. Poweramp appears to just do a basic shuffle where the list is not maintained and various events seem to rebuild it. Just needs a shuffle list function to apply to the playlist and then allow you to save that revised list in the new order.	playlist,shuffle,list,button

equalizer editing	hi, i do not know how other people edit their equalizer but my phone has low resolution, and i can not be precise in my editing. it would be nice to have an alternative to sliding the bands of the eq, or the knobs for bass an trebble, for finer tuning. say long pressing the frequency under a slider in the eq opens up a menu where i can write the amplification value (in or db - someting like +1.8db or -32), and a nice percentage value under the bass and trebble knobs the follows the same principle. looking forward to the answer!	screen,equalizer,play,replay

native last.fm scrobble support	Hi there,I really love Poweramp but what really bothers me is that it only has support for SLS and Scrobble Droid. I know that the official Last.fm app can scrobble song with these notificationsbroadcasts but they are really buggy. E.g. songs are scrobbled if you listened only 10 seconds of them contrary to the 50 or 4 minutes you need with the offical app and every player on the pc. Songs also get scrobble 2 times if you pause them and unpause them after a few minutes.

general question abt the sound quality	Hi everyone. I have been checking out other android music players in the market and noticed some Poweramp users switched to mixzing becus of sound quality issue.(according to the user comments) honestly, i ve tried mixzing myself but couldnt tell much difference. Maybe mixzing provides slightly better sound quality, but how is it possible? both Poweramp and mixzing have eq functions but what would make some ppl move from this app to that one with such aweful interface design?(strictly biased honest personal opinion btw.) So my question is, is there a way for A music player to enhence sound quality of the music output without using eq function?? Maybe bunch of presets or auto-adjusting function would do the job? But then it sounded like they were referring to the actual ability of the music player to extract sound more effectively. (Just like cowon mp3 player can produce far better sound quality than iriver or ipod) so it would be much appreciated if someone can tell me the factors that contribute to the android phone music player#39;s ability to improve the actual sound quality. P.s: not trying to diss other apps. i just want to know what they r claiming is viable.	sound,equalizer,windows,playlist

suggestion for sorting songs	I used many players for android, no one is as powerful as Poweramp. But I think it will be more convenient if it has some features of sorting . The songs in the playlist created by users or automatically by the players(such as highest ranked, most played, last played, etc) should be able to sorted by track name, album, artist, added date(the date that the song is added to library), played times, etc. Sorting manually as before is also needed. In this case, having the features of rating(I know it is in progress), its corresponding auto playlist"higest ranked", counting played times and its corresponding playlist "most played"(the entries should have a limit,e.g.30) are required . Those features could be implemented by the custom tag of "rating" and "playcounter", for example. PS: I know the features of lyrics is in progress, but I also has a suggestion: supporting to display the lyrics in "lyrics" tag of the song file(embedded lyrics).Also, if in there is a colum bar of alphabet displayed at the right side of list menu, it will be more convienent to allocate a song.

linking	Hi, Many of tracks on my playlist, are divided into parts (for example "Shine on you crazy diamond" by Pink Floyd). When i use shuffle mode, it sometimes play random part of the song, which makes listening to it a bit weird. Is there any posibility of adding linking feature? You would link parts of the song together, that would make Poweramp play the whole song instead of just one part of it. Example: it shuffles into Part 2 (which is linked with part three, and one [where Part 1 is marked as the starting one]), checks if the song is linked with anything, then follows the sequence from part 1-3, and returns to normal shuffling order. Sorry if I sound unclear, or if there is some other way to do this (excluding manually merging parts of the song together). Regards	playlist,button,artist,album

itunes song metadata (last play timestamp, rating, etc)	Hello First let me say that I have bought this wonderful application, it does just all I need, beautiful, equalizer, perfect random mechanism. However, now that I see how good you are, I was wondering if the following is possible. I have searched through the list of features request and did not find it : Is there a technicall possibiliy (and will, and no legal issues lol) to add support for the "iTunes metadata" (aka song attributes) such as : - count on number of time the file was played (readwrite) - last play timestamp (readwrite) - volume normalising (read) - 0-5 stars ratings (readwrite) - etc I would love this to work so that I could sync back to itunes and make sure my dynamic list on itunes are updated (as per example I have a dynamic playlist that plays only song that were never played before or not played in the last month, etc...) P.S : now that I typed my request, I start to realise that even if you do add this, I am not sure how to sync back to itunes.... ;o) (I can sync from itunes into my phone, but via a 3rd teer application (HTCsync) which is not snycing both ways... so well...

shuffle-mode	Hello,is there any way to use PA in shuffle-mode and have a real shuffle? I have about 2.000 Songs on my Phone and PA works about 8 - 12 hours per day but it feels like some radio-stations. PA plays a random series of my music but in a short time it play the same songs.I was using Pocketmusic Player before on my Windows Mobile Phone and this player was playing all songs in shuffle until it played ALL songs and there was no double or repeat of any. I could also rearrenge all songs randomly in a playlist there.Useful would be a playlist-function, where I can rearrange the songs in a playlist randomly with a click (from a menu or a button).At all I am missing a playlist-view unattached of the folder or library view.Thank you for this phantastic play and your work!Gunther	playlist,version,library,shuffle
google#39;s gesture search doesn#39;t know poweramp	Hello,thanks for this great music player - I really love it! There is just one small problem: When I use Google#39;s Gesture Search to search for a song on my sdcard, I can play the song only with Android#39;s standard music player or with MP3 Music Download. Unfortunately there is no option to play the file with Poweramp.Device: Orange San Francisco ZTE BladeAndroid: 2.1Is this a problem of Gesture Search or of Poweramp? Would be nice if you could fix it.Kind regardsWolfgang[attachment=0]screenshot.png[attachment]	search,tag,playlist,control

feature request move copy now playing song to folder	So far power amp is coming along nicely. Can you add ability to move or copy the now playing song to another folder, like how adding to a playlist works but instead move or copy the actual mp3 to a folder. This will help tremendously with organizing music on our devices. Also adding support to view and modify the id3 tag rating would be very useful. I will recommend power amp to my fellow android users. Thanks! Mike	playlist,folder,tag,library
more than one equalizer preset on the same output.	Hi. I apologize for my poor English and if this question has already been made. First, congratulations for the great application, it was my first purchase on the market from the early versions and since then has only improved I greatly appreciate the equalizer presets and I like to have more than one on the same input. I make an example: I use Poweramp both with headphones, and in car through the aux connector and the settings have to be be different in the two cases, even if the input is always the 3.5" jack. Perhaps the application could simply open a popup (if it encounters more than one preset on the same input) which provides a rapid choice (in this case headphones or car). I believe that mine is a fairly common scenario that could be appreciated by many, even if it is not actualy a major drawback to manually change the preset Thank you for your attention, I hope in this small addition and look forward to more themes (very much appreciated) and crossfader (I#39;ve read that the this two are already planned).	equalizer,version,title,library
next song jump	Poweramp is super and I can#39;t wait for the next update (fully paid up in the meantime). Is it possible to display the next queued song on the main screen with a button to skip if not wanted? Maybe as an alternative to the track location string (I have an HTC Wildfire and screen space is at a premium so would need some thought about the best way to show)? Similar functionality to the Queek music player which although very buggy is very useful if you#39;re playing tracks randomly. Thanks.	button,playlist,screen,display
volume rocker to skip aheadback	Howdy- No question the best music player available. But one thing keeps me from buying the full version: my old w580 sony had the ability to skip aheadback using the volume rocker, even in the lockdark screen. Is it possible to add this feature? Made skipping around great while mowing the lawn. A thousand thanks for all your hard work.	hardware,skip,volume rocker,button
button to add current time to id3 tag	Hi, First of all, I#39;ve just started using Poweramp and, having tried a number of other music players, I have to say this is easily the best! It#39;s quick, simple to use yet full of features, slick, has a good lock screen widget, etc. so I#39;m impressed, well done I#39;ve got a slightly strange feature request...I#39;m a DJ and mostly listen to other DJ sets which are usually 1 hour plus (sometimes longer than 2 hours) in a single mp3 file. Whenever I hear a tune I like, I want to make a note of it so that I can go and buy it myself. When I#39;m driving my car this isn#39;t easy as I don#39;t have direct access to the tracklist, so I have to make a note of the time in the set the track was played, and then check at home later. Even making this note can be hazardous, or I have to keep stopping the car all the time (or I try to make a mental note but it#39;s easily forgotten). What I#39;d like is to be able to just press a button which simply appends the current time to an ID3 tag (eg. comment). Then when I get home later, I might see something like 13:19, 48:03, 89:52, which I can use to help me find the tracks I want. I#39;m a developer myself and know this should be a pretty simple task, and I know it#39;s not likely to be of use by anyone else, but it would be HUGELY helpful to me. When I become rich and famous as a superstar DJ I#39;ll know who to shower my money on if you can add this feature!	playlist,widget,tag,volume

I think users from Eastern Europe would really appriciate this:-)	tag,display,translation,album
2 important features ! time search and quot;sensitive scrollingquot;	Hi, I think of 2 more features that would make this player the best in the wolrd - When I#39;m listening to an audiobook, i wish that i could save the position where i last stopped playing - so that i can continue at this position the next time i listen to the track. (Perhaps a feature to save the position in tracks with a length of more than 10 min would be possible) A feature like "Go to : " could also solve this problem. My next suggestion is to make the fast-forwarding within one track sensitive- like you have it on the Ipod (Touch). I mean that the fast-forwardingrewinding speed depends on the vertical postion of your finger relative to the timebar. I try to explain: When you touch down on the "progress bar" (that graphically shows you the playing position) and drag your finger to the right than the player should do the fast-forwarding the faster the bigger the vertical distance between your finger and the bar is ! This feature makes it more easy to precisely scroll to a certain position in long tracks Thats it, would be great to see these features with the next updae regards	playlist,album,artist,button
always on lock screen widget	Hey, I was wondering if in a future version you might be able to add the option to always have the music widget displayed on the lock screen and not just when music is playing. The workaround to do this is by starting music and shutting off the screen (normal function). Afterward if the music is stopped the widget lock screen will continue to be the first displayed screen so long as you do not unlock the phone or press the To Lock Screen button.	lock screen,option,screen,widget
balance control	Hi, thanks for a great player! One thing I#39;d really like to see in an upcoming release i balance control. In fact, I haven#39;t seen any android player with balance control, and it would really put Power Amp further ahead of it#39;s competitors. Because of my slight hearing loss on one side the music seems to be tilted towards the left side. Me and probably thousands of people could really use such a feature!

assigning eq presets to foldersalbums	The EQ is top stuff. Creating presets is working very well. But if you have a lot of different types of music in your library, it is also natural to have different EQ-settings based on the kind of music you are listening to. What I would like is a way to set the EQ preset for each album, or folder individually, so that I can set one type of EQ for my rock albums (or a specific album), and another EQ setting for my classical music albums for example. Is this something that would be considered for a future update?	equalizer,version,library,playlist
last lt;lt; playpause gt;gt; next on notification screen	Is this possible, like the stock player has? If I#39;m on any other app and want to switch the song, I have to pull down the notification curtain, click on Poweramp, hit next (or playpause whatever), then go back to the other app. It would be nice to access these functions in the pull down notification screen like the native player does. Thanks, guys. Really great work on this app.	button,version,screen,notification
id3 tag quot;discquot; not recognized	As the title states, the ID3 tag for disc or disc number appears to be ignored. for example, i have an audio book with proper tag.

music folders: can only pick from the root of the sdcard	When choosing your Music Folders, you can currently only choose folders in the root of the SDcard. This means that, if you use the Folder view (rather than the Library view) and if all your music is in e.g. sdcardmediaMusic, you have two unnecessary steps: you need to click #39;media#39; followed by #39;Music#39; each time. The solution would be to both (1) Make the Music Folder selection a tree view, to let you select any folder on the sdcard, not just one in the root; and (2) If you only have one Music Folder selected (e.g. sdcardmedia), the Folder view should show you the contents of it immediately, rather than make you click #39;media#39; to view the contents. Thanks, Simon	folder,library,view,artist

associate playlist filesshortcuts with poweramp	Hi, I have some playlist files (.m3u) stored in my SD, but when I open them with a file manager, Poweramp doesn#39;t open the playlist, it fails and gives an error message. Also, if I create a playlist shortcut in one of my desktop screens, it will open in the default Android player, not in Poweramp. It would be good if playlist files and shortcuts could be associated with Poweramp, so that Poweramp starts automatically when they are openedexecuted.	playlist,format,widget,version
bugfix improvement concerning harddrive based system	Hi together, I#39;m using an archos 70it as MP3 player which has the specificity to work with a 250GB harddrive instead of flash memory. I tried to use Poweramp which was exactly filling my expectations in terms of ergonomy, functionality and quality. Congratulation then for this great work... ... BUT (there#39;s always a but...) after a fex seconds playback, Poweramp doesn#39;t play correctly and regularly, the playback is interrupted for 1 or more seconds, which is unfortunately not acceptable. I tried with many other programs available on Android, but until now only the application delivered by default by Archos is the only one to work. I tried to understand why this happens and I think that the difference between the played is related to the cache memory management: does Poweramp wait that the cache is almost empty to fll it at the last moment (saving the battery, while limiting memory access probably) or does it fills the cache more regularly? I may be problematic with a harddrive because the access time is very long (a few seconds if the HD is stopped physically, again to save battery) and the cache is probably empty when the new data are available. I precise that I tried the different options for cache memory (auto, normal or more) but I didn#39;t see any differences in the behaviour of the player: the HD is stopped and tries to start shortly before the music stops. This may be decisive: if a new version would correct this problem, I#39;d buy your application without hesitating. I thank you in advance for your feedback ! Do some of you experienced this kind of problems? Are there any solutions which I didn#39;t find? PS: Archos 70 it 250GB with Android 2.2; Poweramp V1.1 build 326	library,playlist,playback,option

track replay	When a song is currently playing, I would like to be able to tap on the Previous button to play that song again. Currently, there is no way to do this with Poweramp. The only poor workarounds are to go back to previous track, if any and tap of next track again; alternatively, I could drag the song time bar: not very good options. Poweramp should allow me to go back to beginning of currently playing track upon taping the Previous button once, subsequent tapping should then go to previous tracks. Please implement this option.

quick browse	Unless I need to enable an option or doing something wrong, when browsing songs through the Music folder, I only see an option with a button to scroll faster on the right of the UI. Could you please add an option to browse by first letter while scrolling? This way, I can quickly select a song by sleeting the first letter of the song or artist name. For instance, if I am browsing the music folder from the beginning, by tapping on Y, this should take me at the end of the list to songs by Yana Kay, for instance.

This would be perfect for people like me who use Bluetooth Stereo headphones with A2DP and AVRCP. Thanks, Otto	control,voice control,voice,bluetooth
song announcement	Hello, Could you please consider an option to include the song announcement before playing it? Given that the support of TTS is quite good, this should not be difficult. The implantation of this should be that, if enabled, Poweramp would read aloud the Titled, followed by the Artist, or as set by the user. For instance, before playing a track, Poweramp could say "Now playingNext track Sweet Dreams by Beyonc¨¦". Alternatively, this could be triggered by multiple press of a button.

independent equaliser per track or auto equaliser	Again I noticed that earlier CDs ripped to mp3 are fairly quiet, and fairly flat in their sound, so I bump up the base, then a more modern track comes on and is way too loud, and the base distorts as there is too much. Can you either preset an equaliser per track (and it remembers the set up) or add something like a global equaliser setting (ie rock) and an auto equaliser keeps all tracks somewhere close to the requested setting without distorting the base? That and auto volume would be the best features Poweramp could add... Keep up the good work guys!!	option,playlist,volume,button

shufflerepeat	The way you say shuffle and repeat is kind of confusing. When you press shufflerepeat it says either "all songs" "current artist" or "off". When it shows all songs, when I am on just one artist, it will shufflerepeat songs from everything on my player. But if I am listening to the dynamic queue, it will only shufflerepeat songs from there. This can be kind of confusing. So basically what I think you should do is just give us the option to shuffle the current playlist instead of all songs or current artist. That would mean if we start playing from one artist, that would be the playlist and it would repeat and shuffle just that. Thanks again	shuffle,repeat,control,disable
screensaver	I like to listen to music at night, and I also like having a clock. Right now, I use Poweramp as my media player, and alarm clock plus as my clock.

album art selection settings	Hello, you#39;re player is really awesom, i dont really miss any feature! I am on Android for some days and found it, when i searched for a player with equalizer as my device has a low maximum loudness and i think will buy it at the end of the test period due to the fact that all the other players i found are not really as good as yours. But it#39;s the first time i am on a payed app platform, so firstly i have to look how the android market payment thing work... now here is my request: i have alot samplers on my SD and i dont like to see the sampler cover for a song, but more likely the cover of the real album of the single or at least only a picture of the artist, so maybe you could add an option to chose what Poweramp search for: artist + album artist artist + title artist + album + title btw.: i read something about Poweramp 2.0... if i buy 1.1, i will be able to use 2.0 with the same licence?	equalizer,artist,album art,album
equaliser by album	Wow - this a great media player, I don#39;t use anything else except, occasionally, Lithium, once in a while for crossfade (but I see that#39;s coming in PA V2.0 - fantastic news). Anyhow, I love the ability in the latest update to save equaliser settings, but could we have a function to apply to a range of tracks or more essentially per album, rather than per track for custom settings. This is useful but would lead to hundreds of different equaliser pre-sets and albums tend to suffer from the same problems when it comes to lack of tone. Just allowing the application of any EQ setting to an album would be awesome.	playlist,option,album art,library

make player better for long audio podcasts - ffrw resume	The player is GREAT seriously great, but it really is only geared to music. But it could be great for audio podcasts as well (you have no idea how important an EQ is for podcasts) the problem is there is no way (that I see) to FF or RW through a track or skip a predetermined length of time. Adding these features would be great (how about a long press and hold on the forward button for FF and opposite for RW) - and you could add trackball support for ffRW And a adj button to skip an X # of seconds in a track. Finally having the player pick up where a track was when paused or exited would be invaluable for podcast support. I am sure I am not the only one who would like to use you amazing app for audio beyond music.	button,album,playlist,library

poweramp #39;now playing#39; broadcasts?	I#39;m working an Android app that utilizes the #39;Now Playing#39; track information from the default Android Music Player to do something. While this works like a charm on most cooked ROMs and HTC stock ROMs, but for people using other music players, this obviously fails. The Android Music Player sends out broadcasts on specific actions with Intents such as:- com.android.music.metachanged com.android.music.playbackcomplete and the artist, track and album information is bundled with the Intent. My question is: Does Poweramp send out any broadcasts when these events occur? If not, then is there any possible way in which I can get the Now Playing information from Poweramp?	artist,library,button,playlist
playlists: quot;not in any playlistquot; and others...	I suggest to add the automatically generated playlists: 1. "Not in any playlist" 2. "Recently added" (with setting for what period) 3. "Last played" = last X songs, were played from the beginning to the very end. "X" could be set to time period or amount of songs.	playlist,library,queue,tag
import doubletwist playlists	It would be great if Poweramp could import playlists from other android audio players. The most useful would be support for the doubleTwist .m3u playlists, which are placed in the upper level music directory on the android phone. Many users use doubleTwist to sync iTunes playlists on their PC to their android phones, but use Poweramp as their player in android because it is far superior to the doubleTwist player. Thank you for your consideration of this enhancement.	playlist,button,tag,display

activate voice control with headset button	When using the default music player, I can activate voice control with a long push down of the headset button (in addition to pauseplaynext with single or double click). With Poweramp, controlling the music works fine after enabling headset buttons in the settings.

Otherwise I would buy the app, as I really like it.	control,voice control,voice,button

One thing I really would like, is for the program to remember the last playing position for each song, (or at least a bookmarking option). I listen to long mp3 lectures, and this function is absolutely necessary, since I listen to different lectures at different times. (Please note that many other products on the Market actually have this function, although be sure their general product doesn#39;t come near yours!)

That would be a great addition that makes Poweramp complete - for me at least Br, Kris	playlist,queue,play,library

automatic rating system ala amarok	I know that there is a rating system planned for a future release. I#39;d love such a feature. But i would like to ask Max if he would consider adding an automatic rating system like Amarok has. I, like many other people i guess, have a very large music collection, and i usually do not have the time or the willpower to manually rate every single song. However, with an automatic rating system i can create a playlist based on that automatic score and forget about having to assign a value to each song. For those that do not know how Amarok rates the songs, it is based on how long you play the song. Every song starts at a score of 50100 and then every time the song is played it modifies the score. If the song is skipped at the very beginning, the score is halved. If the song is played till the end, the score is increased on half of the difference between the actual score and 100. And if the song is skipped and any time between the beginning and the end, it adds or substracts lineally. So, for example, if a song were played 4 times till the end and then it was skipped at the very beginning, its scores would be: 1. 50 2. 75 3. 88 4. 94 5. 97 6. 48 Well, at least that is how i always thought it worked, although i may be wrong. Anyway, i think this would be a great addition for an already great player.	playlist,option,album art,rate
upnp support	Hi,First of all, please forgive my English, I#39;m French Your soft is awesome, and before anything, I#39;d like to thank you for providing such a cool app !Well, I don#39;t know if a feature like that would be hard to be added, but I think a really cool thing would be to add UPnP support to Poweramp...When I want to play music, I mostly use Poweramp, but sometimes, I#39;d like to play my music to my Philips Streamium Hi-Fi player. I own an HTC Desire HD, and to do that, I can either use the default player, which allows to choose a player (either phone, or UPnP), thru the "Play to" option, either I use an external app, such as 2player or iMediaShare.Would it be possible in a future release, to add an option to choose to play the smartphone music either on the phone speaker (normal use) either on UPnP ready apparel ?Besides, maybe some users would find usefull a full UPnP protocol support (I mean both being able to "transmit" music from the phone, and to "receive" music from UPnP devices.).Again, I really have no idea of the feasibility of such a feature, but I#39;d be so cool.Best regards	translation,tag,french,bluetooth

I#39;d like to keep them in this state with no assembly, so for users like me (and I think there is many), could you try to make Poweramp doing better transitions between songs, I mean no time between two songs, or maybe this is a system limitation... Hope it hasn#39;t been said already, but I#39;m French and maybe I use the wrong keywords. Thanks	playlist,translation,option,french

more control on folder pics in folder view mode	First of all let me thank you for the great software. However, I#39;d like to suggest to introduce a bit more luxury. To the point: Browsing my music library I mostly use folder mode. Automatic search for album art is a great feature, especially with the ability to choose the right picture from the found variants. But unfortunately this is not extended to the folders. As far as I understood, currently you take a first picture found for one of the files inside the folder and use it instead of default folder icon. There are two problems here: 1. Folder picture is rarely the picture of my choice, but I did not find any way to change it at will 2. If folder contains no files (just another folders) the picture is always default. Sometimes this behaviour drives me crazy... Hence the feature request: a) Needed an ability to change folder picture to the picture of user#39;s choice (pics saved for files contained in this folder can be used as choices in the list) Nested folders must be scanned for the folder pictures as well	notification menu,gingerbread,picture art,folder

external sd recognition	Hello Poweramp, First of all a big thank you for your magnificent music player. The customizability is superb. I#39;ve got a series of devices that I use at work, HTC Desire, HTC Desire Z and so forth and the player works great with my 16Gb SD Card. They don#39;t have internal storage so we#39;re golden. However; I now have a new kind of device, running on Android 2.2, which has an internal storage card (which I don#39;t like at all). I am forced to stick all my music in the "mntsdcardMusicFolders" folder, which is autocreated via the menu option in the folder settings menu. Only then I am able to use the Folder function (which is the best adition with respect to other players, alongside with the superb album art support). now for my question; is it possible that in a future release support for external SD cards in combination with folders is implemented? thanks for your support.	folder,library,playlist,tag

equalizer by genre	Hi. I have never understood why no player has implemented this (that I am aware of). If you can read genre from meta data, and you have custom and preset equalizer settings, I think it would be great if we could set the equalizer to change with each song based on the meta data genre. It would just have to read the meta data and change the equalizer before the song begins to play. A default genre could be used for any track that falls though the track (missing meta data or an odd genre). I shuffle through electronica, alternative, classical, classic rock and other stuff. I didn#39;t see it mentioned in the "todo" list of features. I got today#39;s build that says you can set the genre for each track, but I have not figured out how to do that, plus that seems like a lot of work.	equalizer,version,playlist,genre

Ability to excludedelete track from playlist in every mode 3. Multiple playlist selection while adding to a playlist (e.g. "Favorite" + "Hard-n-Heavy"), the same for excluding from the playlist. 4. Multiple songs selectiondeselection in playlist edit mode. 5. Auto-saving the playlists on the SD Card in own directory (copy of the system playlists) - in order not to lose the info after re-installing the ROM. Also interesting would be possibility to restore the saved playlists into a system data, making them available for other players. 6. Ability to RATE tracks while playing and ability to SORT and to create Playlists on this basis (e.g. "My 3 Stars" etc.) 7. If it#39;s possible to make sorting on Rating inside Playlist - would be PERFECT - so user won#39;t need to make playlist like "My favorite", "My very favorite", "My most favorite" and so on..

re-organize playlist files (and save custom eq settings)	I love creating playlists within the app (it#39;s very easy to do), but I#39;d love an option where I can change the order of the files (maybe an "edit" option by pressing the menu button within the playlist, then drag the files around). I tend to just add files to the playlist willy-nilly, and then I want them in a specific order (for a workout or commute or whatever). If I could just dump all my files into the playslist, then easily edit the order of the files within the app, that would be ideal. Also, like most Poweramp users, I#39;d love to be able to save my custom EQ#39;s, so if I want to try out a preset, I can easily go back to my custom one.

media scan, unlock screen, menu options	I’ve been playing with the Poweramp a lot lately and I love what I see. I do have some comments and observations that perhaps may make this great product even better, thanks for listening!- Media scan (a biiiiig deal)I have a 32G external SD with more than 8,000 tunes. This is a problem because Android automatically invokes Media Scan on every change on SD and on every Reset which forces long delay even if nothing was changed in the music folders. Poweramp has an option to skip its music folders from the external SD during Media Scan (great!) but it does not have an option to force that scan from within Poweramp. This is another problem because if I want that scan them to update the Library list then I need to change the Poweramp option and then reboot the phone – kind of a clunky process (unless I#39;m missing something). If I#39;m not missing anything then what about an ability to force Media scan from within Poweramp (from the main System Library panel?) for the folders that are explicitly disabled with the existing option? That would be huge! There is a general discussion on the XDA forum of that type of approach, here: http:forum.xda-dev... ... ?t=732462#- Swipe to Unlock Screen (very minor)I wonder why the unlock screen option for the locked screen widget does not work the way standard android unlock does: swipe to the right. I would prefer that default swipe with the widget instead of the two options that currently exists (tap to unlock or tap to get to the swipe). A minor detail really.- Menu (very minor)I wonder why Menu does not display items the way other apps do (like Menu on the Home screen) and instead uses these tiny buttons as part of the actual panel. I would prefer the “standard” way because it is easier to see and more of what I would expect.

However, not only would it be great to save the custom settings, but to have given ones load automatically with a song would be even better. I know that#39;s probably asking a lot, but not all songs sound ideal with a given and fixed setting. Some need more bass, some less, for example. Anyway, the program is great, but, without being able to save eq settings, experimentation becomes a #39;hazard#39;. BTW I noticed a #39;being worked on#39; item that is supposed to show (I think) that saving EQ settings is...being worked on. However, I could not find reference to that in the item itself.

integration with samsung desk home app	Samsung provides a nice dock for the Galaxy S GT-I9000 (and the related variants like T-Mobile Variant). That dock connects to the phone only via mircoUSB but the dock itself does have an audio out on the back. When the phone is in the dock then the sound is channeled to that audio out (via microUSB somehow) so that you can have speakers connected there. In order to have that audio out option working one has to be on froyo 2.2 or higher, has to install the official Samsung Desk Home app (see the attachment), and has to enable a proper setting within that app. The idea of the app is to replace the default android home screen with a pre set functionality applicable to a phone in a dock used as an alarm clock, etc. (let’s not argue that – it works for that purpose)In that scenario, when I invoke AudioAMP and slide the phone into the dock then the screen switches to the Desk Home UI and the AudioAMP music is channeled to the external audio out as expected. But now I don’t have the AudioAMP UI to control the music (or access to the phone’s volume buttons which are blocked by the dock) so I need to hit the Desk Home Exit button (or Android Back) to get to the AudioAMP controls (Android Home button is tied to that Desk Home app in this case) . Unfortunately as soon as I exit Desk Home UI the music instantly switches to the phone speaker and stays that way until I switch back to the Home Desk UI (by hitting the Home button) in which case the music switches back to the dock audio out. You see how awkward this music flipping is.I tested the same scenario with the IG I-9000 stock music player and it does exactly the same when following the same scenario (exiting Home Desk to get to the player’s UI). However … the Home Desk app has a default icon for the stock player (the one in the middle) and when I use that to get to the player controls then the music continues to be channeled to the dock’s audio out – it never returns to the phone’s speaker. You see how nice this is.Soooooooo the question is: can AudioAMP provide integration with the Home Desk app the way that stock player does? – ideally by reusing the same player icon.In case it matters here’s what I have:- GT-I9000 unbranded and unlocked- Froyo 2.2.1 (JPY)- Home Desk rev 1.0 (rev 1.0.1 crashes on my phone)- dock bought in the US as an accessory for T969 Vibrant (T-Mobile) , but it’s the same as dock for GT-I9000BTW, there is also a related Desk Car app for an alternate Samsung dock meant for cars but I assume that there is no such issue since I don’t believe that that dock has an audio out – but I did not test it since I don’t have that dock.The dock:http:www.samsung.c... ...

Thanks!	album art,playlist,version,screen
browse albums by genre	Hi! I really would like to be able to browse albums by genre. Currently, when selecting genre in the library, I get a list of all SONGS from that genre. When listening to music, I usually first pick a genere and then an album. Most mobile players I used in the past years had this option. I was really surprised that the state-of-the-art Android music player doesn#39;t support this view. If an album has songs from several genres (none of mine has, btw.), just list the complete album under more than one genre. Otherwise, keep up the good work! Best, ZardoZ	playlist,library,sort,genre
disable bluetooth integration?	I run a BlueAnt S4 Bluetooth hands free speaker in my car for making and receiving calls. My problem is, I use my headphone jack on my DroidX to send music into my stereo. Whenever I play my music in Poweramp, it comes through my Bluetooth speaker instead of my headphone jack. I could turn off Bluetooth, but then I wouldn#39;t be able to use it to make calls etc. I have looked a bit, but have not found a setting in Poweramp that says, "don#39;t use Bluetooth".

dedicated folderlibrary button	Hi, I#39;ve been testing Poweramp for a few days and I like what I hearsee so far. There is just one minor annoying thing: you have to press menu to go to the folders library browser. I#39;d like there to be a dedicated button on the player interface that takes me here, without having to hit the menu hardbutton. The htc and samsung default players both have this and for me this provides a more fluent workflow. Going to the library to select music is a too common action to be hidden behind the menu button (my gf couldn#39;t get music to play because she always forgets the thing exists) Also the buttons that appear when you press menu are very small. They#39;re quite hard to hit and I don#39;t even have thick fingers. It looks very nice, but I think I prefer the standard android menu popup just for ergonomics: these buttons are a lot larger and therefore easier to hit. Half the time I hit eq instead of folderlibary. Sorry for the long post. I#39;m really happy with this app and looking forward to what you come up with next. Keep up the good work!	button,playlist,library,screen

lyrics tag on flac files	I#39;ve read you#39;re going to add a more complete lyrics support in next revisions of Poweramp... I have my collection of CDs ripped to FLAC files, with the lyrics included in a "LYRICS" tag. So, it would be great if information included in this tag would be shown as the lyrics of corresponding song. Additionally, I#39;ve had some files where lyrics where included in "LYRIC" tag, instead of "LYRICS". Maybe would be great if different "similar tags" would be taken into accout to get the information of lyrics... (In some PC programs this is even customizable: in a configuration menu you can choose which tags should be shownused to get the information of lycics, composer, etc.). Thank you in advance!!	tag,lyrics,flac,notification
auto reduction of all other audio levels on headphone	Auto reduction of all other audio levels on headphones connect.

preset eq to compensate for dynamic in ears	G#39;day, Many low to mid range earphones (canal phones) based on Dynamic drivers have a frequency response that lacks bass has a peak at the resonant frequency (for most about 3 KHz with Dynamic drivers) and then rolls off steadily beyond 10-11 KHz. A preset that approximates the inverse of the average response curve would be good. This suggestion is not for me so much as I have Canal-phones with Balanced Armatures. but I#39;m always surprised that preset Eq#39;s don#39;t often include at least one attempt.	library,equalizer,playlist,backup
shuffling folders	Hi, This is really great app, however there is one feature that i would like to see in the future releases. The feature that I have in mind is shuffling entire folders, *NOT* the songs inside the folders. For example when the playlist would reach the last song of a currently playing folder, it would randomly select the next folder and play all songs in that folder. An example of the this feature can be found on foobar2000 audio player. You can try this feature inside foobar2000 by selecting from menu Playback-Order-Shuffle(folders). Of course there is no need to implement this feature on main UI the of Poweramp(It would be nice though if implemented). It could just activated from settings menu, for example with a checkbox(Shuffle folders). Anyway, Poweramp is really great for being very feature rich and FAST(please keep it that way ). Thanks!

not detecting .alc or .flc (alac and flac) files	Awesome product, works incredibly (sorry, had to do it) well on my DInc. The only real issue I have been experiencing is, when SqueezeCommander downloads files off my squeezecenter server, it#39;s changing the file extension from alacflac (or m4a) to .flc or .alc. These file types are apparently ignored by your folder scanner (if i open them from astro they play in Poweramp), however if I manually change the extension then re-scan, the folder immediately pops up. This is a pain since apparently astro can#39;t do it (and I change out music using squeeze a lot!). Naturally, I#39;ll be opening a bug with the author of SqueezeCommander as well, but in the meantime can you please add support for the .alc and .flc extensions? Great product, all of these options to customize everything about the player is what android is all about!

optional playback engine?	Hi, I see elsewhere people have asked about support for other variants of WMA, and you#39;ve commented that you#39;ll never be able to support DRM. I#39;ve just got a Galaxy Tab, and was really pleased to see how well its support for DRM works. I was also pleased to see that it had been implemented in a way that meant it works in other music players (that wasn#39;t the case on an Archos device I have which also implements WMA DRM). However, I was disappointed to find that that doesn#39;t extend to Poweramp. I realise that that#39;s a tradeoff against the fact that Poweramp supports other formats (e.g. FLAC) that the device otherwise wouldn#39;t support, because it uses its own method for decoding the audio. Is there any possibility of you somehow allowing it to use the OS decoders in certain scenarios? Either where it detects that it just doesn#39;t support the format, or simply through a toggle in the settings? I realise that this would probably be complicated - and in particular certain functionality (equalizer maybe?) might depend on doing the decoding itself, but on the other hand it might give a number of gains (for instance, if Poweramp doesn#39;t support formats that the device#39;s native player supports, that#39;ll encourage people to stick with their native player) Do you think it#39;s totally out of the question, or something you might be able to add onto the feature request list?

re: todo listfeatures in progress	Hi, I#39;m glad to see that ratings is coming with version 2!! Have you any plans yet with regards to the mechanism with which Poweramp#39;s users will synchronize their ratings with their PC? If not, I have an idea to propose: Suggestion of a Ratings and Synchronization System: You don#39;t have to do like Apple or DoubleTwist and write your own PC Music Player to manage ratings, playlists and synchronize with the phone. You can go with Songbird which as far as I#39;m concerned is far superior to either doubleTwist or iTunes. It has the ability to export and import iTunes Libraries. It takes extensions that would be quite straight forward to write. You could just write a Songbird extension that synchronizes Music Files, Pictures, Videos, Playlists and Ratings with Poweramp on the Android Phone. The ratings can be stored in an SQLite file on the phone. There are extensions that are already on the Songbird market that are open source that you can potentially modify the code to come up with 80 of the code you need (if you accept the terms of GPL). The first is called FolderSync, it syncronizes Media Files with directories that the users already specify. It also writes m3u playlists. The second is called RatingFile, it exports the Ratings of the Songbird library to a srf file. Potentially, you can combine these two codes to come with something specifically tailored for Poweramp. Songbird is available on Windows, Mac and a Linux version of Songbird called Nightingale is in the works.	shuffle,ratings,widget,version
auto playlist	Hi! I would like to suggest a feature I#39;ve seen in a PC application. I had a program that was connected to last.fm, and when you were listening to a playlist and you reached the end, it searched in last.fm similar artistssongs af the playlist, and played them if they were in your library. I think it is a very good way to generate auto playlists, because you don#39;t have to configure settings about type of music, type of artist, etc... you only add some songs you want to listen, and last.fm, which has a very good random playlist generator, helps the program. I know it#39;s an advanced feature, but maybe you like to add it any time... Alex P.D: The program I was using to do this was MediaPortal, an HTPC front end. Just in case you want to try how it works...	button,playlist,lastfm,song play count

viewing playcount in library for podcast support?????	This may be better left till there is better podcast support, however it would be nice to be able to distinguish between an unplayed and a played podcast within a playlist. Heres a usage example. I use iTunes to manage and download my podcasts. I have smart playlists setup to include podcasts with a 0 playcount. I use iSyncrWifi to sync my playlists to my phone. I have Poweramp set to scrobble using Simple LastFm Say for example I have 10 podcasts in a playlist and I start to work my way through them on my phone during the day, unless I remember manually through the day which i have listened to, I have no way of seeing in Poweramp which podcasts are still to be played. The only way is to wait until I am home again and resync to PC with iSyncrWifi and see which ones automatically disappear. Not sure how it could be implemented, but perhaps an option to slightly change the background color of the item when viewing playlistlibrary based on playcount =0. I dont know if it is an itunes specific thing to have all podcasts given the Genre of "Podcast" but it could limit it to those to avoid doing it for all songs. Although to be honest I#39;d be quite happy with just having an option to turn it on or off and have it apply to all songs. I guess this would need some careful thought so as to not mess things up.	library,playlist,podcast,menu

separate eq for lr channels	I#39;ve been checking out Poweramp for a little while and find that it works very nicely. The equalizer in particular is a benefit for me as I am somewhat hearing impaired and can boost the higher frequencies to help compensate. However, the hearing loss is not the same in both ears. I use behind the ear type hearing aids, so lightweight, on the ear headphones don#39;t really put much sound through them. It occurs to me that separate LR EQ (and volume) would permit adjusting music to each ear as needed. This should be in addition to the overall equalizer. I posted a query on the AC site asking if anyone knew of such a music player out there, but got exactly zero responses. If there aren#39;t any music apps like this out there, it might be worthwhile to consider developing one. Consider that there are probably several million people like me out there who would love to be able to optimize how they hear music. Even people with #39;normal#39; hearing may not hear the same in both ears and might benefit from this. Thanks. Curlyjim	equalizer,option,version,volume

new year#39;s offer?	Hello everyone. First and foremost, Happy New Year to all! Now, I#39;ve been using this app for a few days and couldnt be more happy with it, I truly think its THE best player in the market today and I thoroughly congratulate its creator. But I must say that my current situation as a 3rd world country dweller doesent allow me to pay for the full app, sadly, the exchange rates here are far from convenient (around 1:5, or worse, depending on the day.). Now, dont get me wrong, Im not trying to beg, or anything like that. But ive noticed that some of the apps I use are getting new year#39;s discount, some 50, some 60, and there#39;s a couple that are even free for a few days (Awesome). And I was thinking that if Poweramp did a sale like this it could really push sales and get a lot of people to convert to it from other, lesser players. I know Ive been waiting for a chance to ditch my ugly ass and cheap player. Even if the disccount was for 50 and a couple of days it would still make a difference for the people who arent getting their sallaries in euros or dollars (no offense guys). I know I would spam the crap of many a friend#39;s inbox with the offer. Thats all I wanted to say, I sincerely hope the Poweramp creator will consider something like this, It can only do good for the software. Thanks for your time.	version,playlist,button,windows

shuffle albumfolder	Very impressed with Poweramp app, works perfectly so far on HTC Desire, in particular love the EQ functionality. One thing needed to perfect it though, is adding shuffle by albumfolder. As an ex ipod user this is one thing I really miss, my ipod used to surprise me sometimes, and I now don#39;t want to have to choose what album I listen to every time. Unless I#39;m missing something as far as I can see Poweramp always shuffles by song, wherever I start shuffle from.

I don’t like using the “Library” folder because it reads program files plays some of my games soundboards, after a few stops playing because it “played to many incorrect files.” If you can make that happen, or maybe have us pick the folders to read from in “Library” folder so we don’t get files from games, ie. gameloft games.Thank You,Sener	folder,playlist,library,sort

media volume on headset (auto)	Hello, is it possible to make the media volume automatic to 100 when a headset is connectet (wiredbluetooth)? Or a setting for a volumelevel only for Poweramp and not the system volume? My media phone is always on 30 and i use a bluetooth headset with Poweramp. When i use Poweramp i must manually set the volume to 100 on the telephone and later back to 30 (on 100 is the volume to loud in games *g*). Sorry for my bad englisch, i hope you understand me.	volume,button,bluetooth,option

lockscreen large widget	Hi, I#39;m finally using this lockscreen with the big widget since it doesn#39;t conflict with trackball to unlock when I#39;m not playing music. What I wanted to request as a feature would be that I noticed you can use the trackball point and click to interact with the buttons on the screen (maybe an option to disable if people are pressing by accident too much?) so since I use the trackball to wake the device, my usual next action is to click again to unlock, but the default placement for the trackball is on the playpause, so this ends up pausing the playback. What I wanted to request was if you could place the default location on the unlock button, so that for me (and any users using CM or a trackball to unlock mod) a double click on the trackball would wake and unlock even while playing music and using the lockscreen. Thanks! Adolfo	lockscreen,widget,jeelybean,lock screen
respond to headset buttons needs another option	Need a option to respond to headset buttons only when player is active. Every time I use Poweramp I have to click the setting for "Respond to Headset Buttons" and then disable it when I get done using it. I use other audio players for podcasts, audiobooks and recorded radio programs and none of them take over the controls like Poweramp. One of my other players has a option to "only override when player is active" and the others just do it automatically. If Poweramp bookmarked podcasts, audiobooks and radio talk shows then it would be the only player needed but since I need several I need to control which player responds to bluetooth controls. Changing settings every time Poweramp is used is a nuisance.	button,screen,bluetooth,display
forward button	Great player, love it. Great recent update. This is probably one of those #39;niche#39; features, but I used to use a windows mobile player called nitrogen. You could set it so when you pressed the skip button, the album art and song title changed to the next song, but didn#39;t actually start playing it until you pressed the play button. If you left the new album art and song title up after pressing the skip button, when the current song playing finished, it would play the song you left on the screen. It was particularly useful when you were shuffling all songs, you could kind of skip through the shuffle and choose the next song you wanted to hear, but the shuffle kind of worked as #39;suggesting#39; the next song as you skipped through. Hopefully that makes sense. I always thought that was a great a feature and had never seen it anywhere else (and have never seen it since). I have no experience with coding or programming, so I have no idea how hard this would be - but the nitrogen player was pretty simple, so I would guess it#39;s not that hard. Anyway, thought I#39;d throw it out there, again great player, can#39;t wait for the update that includes hierarchical folders and a now playing queue!!	button,playlist,shuffle,search

quick library context switching from player activity	I love that Poweramp remembers the library context I#39;m currently in and selects the next song accordingly. The only thing I#39;m missing is a way to quickly change to a different context from the player activity. My proposal in an example: 1. The user wants to play Reggae 2. He navigates to Genres-Reggae and selects a song 3. After a couple of minutes a Bob Marley song starts playing 4. The user decides that he now only wants the album of the current song to be played, not all the Reggae songs in his library. 5. He long presses on the cover art 6. A categories dialog appears with the options "Artist, Album, Genre, Folder" 7. He selects "Album" 8. The dialog closes and Poweramp internally changes the playback context to the album, without changing the current activity 9. A notification appears on the screen to confirm the selection 10. By clicking on "" the user can now skip through all songs of the current album 11. Clicking the mini info display will open the library activity with the list of songs of the current album I think this feature would greatly increase the comfort and speed of jumping between different categories in a big library.	playlist,library,album art,artist

Amazing app, keep up the good work (please ). It seems I can#39;t shuffle within a playist, only within an album. If i click shuffle all while listening to a playlist, it plays all my songs (shuffled). Is there a way to treat a playlist as an album, and have the shuffle album function work for playlists?.

album length, most played amp; maybe...	First of all, thank you Poweramp guys for making EASILY the best music player in the world, it has everything a man could ever want. And the fact I can simultaneously look at song lyrics from a tag and play a song blows my mind. Now there are just a couple of small things I miss from my Nokia#39;s music player: The album length ( basically the overall length of any library entry there is (artist, playlist, all songs...) "most played" playlist that practically counts every time you play a song and keeps track of what are your most "favorite" songs. What would be ¨¹ber-shm¨¹ber cool would be a real counter next to every song you play that says how many times you have played it. Now my third wish sounds crazy, not even nokia has this, but imagine how cool this would be: a smaller timeline that shows how far along you are on the album! So when you listen to a song and it#39;s in about 3:23 of 5:00, you can see another timeline that says 13:01 of 43:51 because it#39;s the fourth song on the album or whatever.

Again i have take the phone out of my pocket and start playing . It will be very good if it can resume after the phone call was ended 2) When we start this application , while its playing , if we go to home page we lock the screen manually the mp3 player stops . it doesnt play in the back ground . however , its good that , if the screen locks automatically after the wait timer , it still continues to play . I hope the app can be imporved to continue playing in background even if we go to home page we lock the screen manually . Hope to have a update on this soon .

track ordering by id tag file number in folder view	Unless I have misunderstood something (which is far from impossible), it seems to me that when viewing the contents of an album in Library view, the tracks are ordered correctly on the basis of the ID3 track number tag. If viewing the contents of the same album in Folder view, however, the tracks can only be viewed in the correct order if the files in that folder are named are named to include the track number. Is that correct? So, if I name my tracks like this: 01ThisTrack 02 AnotherTrack 03MoreTracks ...then the Folder view can display and play them in the correct order. If I name my tracks like this, however (and only keep the track number in the ID3 tag): ThisTrack AnotherTrack MoreTracks ...then the Folder view will display my tracks in alphabetical order: AnotherTrack MoreTracks ThisTrack (My personal feeling is that track numbers, album and artist name, etc, should live in the mp3 file metadata (ID3 tag) rather than existing as part of the file name. I know this is an idealogical view that is somewhat divisive - but I know I#39;m not alone in managing my mp3 collection like this! I digress...) I think I understand some of the reasons behind this approach to Folders. For example, I imagine that not all file formats handled by Poweramp have ID3 tags. And I know that the current approach makes it easy to make custom compilations that play in the intended order by simply renaming the files. Nevertheless, I would love to have the flexibility to ask Poweramp to order Folder mp3 tracks on the basis of ID3 tags rather than the numerical ordering of file names. This would enable users like me to have all the Poweramp benefits of Folder navigation (not to mention the excellent gapless playback), without having to rename every mp3 file to include the track number. Hooray! So how about it? -Matthew	tag,folder,id3,library

folderlibraryplaylist button on main screen	Love this app! One addition that would make this perfect is easier access to the folderlibraryplaylist screen. Currently from the main player screen you have to press menufolderartist or playlist (all on the left hand side of the screen which makes it difficult to reach when using one hand on some of the larger screens like my EVO). This is 3 key presses which seems alot for me considering I just want to switch artist or playlist. A single small button on the right hand side of the screen could take you there with 1 press and allow for switching album, artist, song, playlist with one hand(essential for driving),the repeat button could be resized smaller(similiar size to eqpre buttons) and the new button could be placed next to repeat button. Or the repeat AND shuffle button could be resized smaller and placed next to each other on the left side of screen, the new folderplaylist button could be on the right. I understand the need for a clean looking interface but this change(the addition of a single button) would be huge for useability! Please? Pretty please?!!! PS it would also be nice if there was an add new playlist selection on the playlist screen(would eliminate 2 keystrokes).	repeat,playlist,button,segment a-b

Perhaps every time Poweramp starts it could do a "slow background" scan - that way it would be unobtrusive. Or maybe set up an auto scan time each day.

sound enhancement	Hi. Though I am very happy with your product, it would be great if you can improve the sound for this player, especially the master volume. I want to get one of the high-end earphones (audio technica ATH-CM7-TI or anything along the line...) to get the profoundrich sound and I find your master volume is still not loud enough.. Also, there have been a number of comments about the sound being one of the weakness of your product (posted on the android market board by the korean users). Plus, eventhough your equalizer function is sophisticated enough to provide wide range of presets, it would be great to improve the sound quality of the raw music output itself if that is not too much trouble. I am well aware that you cannot provide everything, howevever, most people here use this prog. as a substitute for their mp3 player(myself for example), so enhancement in terms of the sound quality should be placed as one of the top-priorities for your upcoming updates... I know this is not an mp3 player, (maybe I#39;m being greedy) so you probably cannot get the same level of quality, but still, I am just expressing my humble opinion...hoping one day, my phone can truly replace mp3 player...

customize folder view	I#39;d like to be able to customize the whole folder view.. I personally sort all my music in different folders, first a main folder for each artist, than subfolders for album and then the tracks inside each subfolder... with the current behaviour, I#39;ve been having to re-name all my subfolders to "Artist - Album" to get all albums by the same artist next to each other in the folder view... My suggestion is to make it possible to freely re-arrange the order which folders are shown in, and possibly re-name and create new folders only shown within the player, possibly similar to how the folder playlists work, but with more customization as I just explained.. or add this functionality to the folder playlists perhaps? Also.. the ability to select how the folder view is organized from different presets is also a suggestion, these could be: - Show all folders in (e.g) sdcardmusic (This would display all folders in selected folder on the SD-card, with sub-folders in them.. useful if your like me and sort all your music in separate folders for each artist and sub-folders for each album.. navigating would be like this: In folder view, you#39;ll see a list of main folders in the said music folder on the SD-card, rather than only folders containing music files, when you than select a artist ) - Show all folders containing music files (current behaviour pretty much) Can#39;t think of any more at the moment... but I#39;ve gotten another suggestion too... In the folder view: when you touch the thing on top saying "Showing X folderSelect all items" right now, you can add all to playlist or delete all.. but a 3rd option could be "Display all" which will bring up one big list of all your music in the Poweramp library (in a alphabetical order of course).. this is usefull if you want to display all your music in one list but have disabled the system scanner from scanning your music folders in the advanced folder options... also, when you press menu in the folder view, there is a empty space next to the "Shuffle all" option, why not add a "play all" option which would have the same effect, except for that it will not enable the shuffeling so that all songs plays in order...	equalizer,all,repeat option,last played

album art swiping suggestion	I know you can disable the album art swiping to change track, but I#39;d like the ability to disable it for the lock screen widget (and possibly widgets in general) only, while keeping it enabled in the player... It#39;s getting slightly annoying at times when I#39;m trying to unlock the phone and accidentally change the song by being used to doing a gesture to unlock rather than tapping the unlock button. Another suggestion would be to make the album art follow the finger when you swipe, for some eyecandy.. also, perhaps also not switch track until you let go off the screen, like, the way it is at the moment, you can touch the album art, move your finger left or right, still keeping your finger on the screen, and it will still change to the previousnext track..	album art,playlist,screen,volume

stop button (on long press of play button)	I requested this feature to Max in an email and he agreed already that it is planned and that he would add to TODO (as he did).

The current existing #39;Stop#39; method in Poweramp is to press on the #39;time elapsed#39; text, however this only stops the track very briefly and then plays it again. With this Stop button added on long press it would keep the track stopped until the user chooses to play it again.

Right now it#39;s one nasty extra tap for such users each time they navigate to their folder playlists. Also it would be great if the "library", "playlist" and "folders" buttons would bring you back to the previously selected levelplaylistfolder. You could make it so that a short tap brings you to the previously visited levelplaylistfolder, wheres a long tap brings back the root level. You could make an option that allows to choose the default behaviour for short and long taps.	playlist,library,button,folder

track options from the main player screen, as well as list?	This one#39;s a simple little request. It would be nice to be able to long-press on the "now-playing" area of the main player screen (i.e. the Track Ttle, Artist, Album Title, etc wording) to get the same useful pop-up that you get via a long-press in the files-list screen (e.g. stuff like Add to PL, Ringtone, Info, Delete, etc). I tend to delete podcasts after listening, so it#39;d be really handy to have that option from the main player screen when the show starts wrapping up. At the moment, I have to press once to get to the files list and then again to get the pop-up option. Andre	option,lock screen,button,delete
midmidi playback	Back when i was a dial-up user midi#39;s were the only kinds of song i could stream or download without waiting all day so i have collected quite a few of them. I would appreciate it much if you could find a way to make the player support them. thanks very much for making this app! my only regret with this app is no one told me about it sooner! and to think all this time i was using the stock player....

shortcut on the home screen	I#39;m a user of Lithium player, and I miss one of its feature.

That could be a great improvement for your app	playlist,artist,screen,folder
feature request: poweramp shortcuts	I would like to ask MaxPMZ to consider for the upcoming versions an implementation of Android shortcuts for controls that are not implemented in the current * Playlist - Creating the playlist shows a list of all playlists Poweramp has detected. User chooses playlist, can set whether the playlist starts from beginning or from the last played song, whether it is shuffled or not, and creates the shortcut. clicking the shortcut will play the chosen shortcut. * Equalizer - Creating the playlist shows a list of all equalizer presets in Poweramp. User chooses preset and creates the shortcut. clicking the shortcut will switch the equalizer to the preset. * Edit Tags - Creates a shortcut that causes PlayerAMP to open tag edit window for the last played or the currently playing song. * Add to Playlist - Creates a shortcut that causes PlayerAMP to send the currently played song to a chosen Playlist, or shows a list of Playlist the user can choose to add the song to.	playlist,library,option,version

output audio to headphone jack while connected to bluetooth	Hey.. First off I just want to say great job on power amp..I#39;m really loving it so far.. at first I wasn#39;t sure if I should buy Poweramp because I really loved the music player on my galaxy s.. However, I realized it has issues in my opinion.. First, sound quality.. It#39;s pretty bad, volume kinda goes up and down on different frequencies, second, theres no"shuffle all" option from the library, third it has no 4x4 widget.. (I#39;m sure there#39;s more but these are the ones that immediately come to mind.. That said, Poweramp addresses all of those downfalls from the stock player.. (btw, the 4x4 home and lock widgets were the kicker that made me decide to purchase Poweramp), anyhoo, on with the feature request My problem is that there is currently no way other than going into the stock player to change the audio output.. Let me explain. When I#39;m in my car, I plug my phone in an auxiliary jack to make use of the video out feature, but I still need bluetooth to be paired for phone calls, but as soon as I connect via bluetooth, Poweramp automatically outputs the audio to bluetooth, so which means no sound at all in my case.. The only way I#39;ve been able to get around this is by launching the default player, start playing a song so I can get into "now playing", press the menu button and chose the "via phone" option, stop the music, exit the default player, launch Poweramp and play music.. So, would it be possible to have that same option in Poweramp or some kind of preference to set a default output? This would be really awesome and would allow me to put my galaxy s music player to rest once and for all, and Poweramp would reign as the new king of music on my phone! Keep up the great work and I hope you consider my request.. sly	bluetooth,option,volume,lock screen
album art grid view for folders?	Hello all.Firstly, thank you for such a great music player. I bought it as soon as it became avaliable for purchase, and I love it. It#39;s especially easy to use while driving due to the gestures on album art.I was wondering, the folder list looks a little simple at the moment. Would it be possible to implement a grid style album view for it, like in iTunes and XBMC (screens attached). This would not only have an obvious visual improvement, but it would also be much easier to quickly change an album whilst driving, or doing other things.Here#39;s a couple of example screenshots. I#39;d really appreciate any feedback or thoughts on this.	album art,playlist,library,view
screen on for a few secs on song change	Just thought of another idea. When I#39;m studying, and the phone is on the table, or when I#39;m in the car and the phone is in its cradle - I listen to music but I don#39;t keep the screen on all the time (battery drain). It would be cool if there was an option that if the screen is off, then when a song changes the player would turn the screen on for a few seconds, so you could see the song name and and art and then turn it back off automatically. What do you think?	screen,volume,button,lock screen

audio volume balance ?	Hi, I would like to know if it is possible to add an audio volume balance control (as we can find in many computer softwares) ? I don#39;t know why but my earphones don#39;t deliver the same volume to the right and the left side, left is a little louder... It sucks but they are expensive and i don#39;t want to change them while a little software adjustment solves the problem. It would be great if i could equilibrate this volume balance on my phone too just as i do on my computer. Great equalizer + audio balance = the killer app for me ! Thank you. Best regards.	l-r tracks,balance,volume,button

my opinion	Hi! This player is REALLY amazing! I couldn#39;t find any decent player until the day I discovered Winamp player. That was great (i like the enqueue fonction) but the design was not very good. Then I#39;ve found Poweramp, what attracted me most are the colors, the smoothness and the equalizer of course! There is just one thing that makes me hesitate with the sense player: Although the lists of songs are very well designed, i think the buttons and the player could be way more polish if I compare to the sense player or the iphone#39;s one... Even the programm icon looks pixellised on my Legend (or at least not very clean). That being said, i really respect your work! That was just a suggestion I#39;ll of course buy it when my trial version ends !	button,playlist,widget,album art
features for large collections	I am going to get a 32 GB memory card and dump my entire record collection to my phone (my stereo runs from my hard drive). That does need some special features: * Hierarchical folder display which I know is on the TODO list. * The ability to play all of the files in a folder, straight through in sorted order, and stop. In PC players, this is usually handled by creating a temporary play-list by a "Select All" button. Being able to tap on a folder or album to play it would be nice. This is really important and many PC media players do not handle it very well. * At least one saved play-list with the ability to play it straight through or a random shuffle, independent of the folder layout. I can#39;t tell if this feature already exists or not. I have had problems figuring out how the play-list feature works. Thanks for the good work, especially the equalizer and support for the FLAC and OggVorbis codecs! Mike	folder,playlist,library,version

display embeeded album art in flac files	Displaying embedded cover art embedded in FLAC files would be a very nice addition, and it doesn#39;t appear to be very difficult to implement. FLAC files use OGG tags, which have supported standardized embedded album art for a while now. I have attached a small snippet of a track in FLAC format complete with tags and embedded album art for testing. Implementing this feature would be a very big help to me, as I make many folder based compilations which require album art to be embedded within the file itself. Also, it would just make Poweramp that much cooler Thanks you for all your effort!Description taken from http:wiki.xiph.org...mment#Coverart follows:...	tag,album art,embedded,cuesheet
searching	Okay, I have two suggestions to improve the ability to search for songs... 1. Lets say your in the main folder menu and wants to find a specific song, so you hit the search button and type in the title of the song, but do you find what you want? Probably not since it only searches for folders with that name, why not also search through the folders for songs with the matching title too? Then when you find your song and touch it to play, it plays the song from within the direct folder. 2. Why not also add support for adding Poweramp to the list of searchable items? Then of course you can filter out what to search in, e.g only search for folders, only search media library, only search for folders and songs within etc..	search,library,version,button
cover art	I would like to see the cover art for each song: 1)when browsing the All songs list. (for reference the HTC player does this.) 2)when browsing the playlist. 3)when browsing inside the folder. Basically the same way as when you browse the albums, you see little cover art on the left for each album. i would like to see that option for each song. Most mp3 now days have cover art embeded in them. BTW this is the most awesome player.	album art,playlist,tag,cover
cover flow	Anyway you can do some type of Cover Flow in the landscape mode.	album art,display,cover,button
galaxy s music app features	Thanks for the request. Samsung Galaxy S is one of my test phones, so I do know what features its music app has. 1. PowerAMP already have the Alpha indexer (Standard android one - works when you have alpha-num sort enabled, not for track # based sorts). It#39;s possible to add the optional always-visible a-z line, though this will work only for english, and i#39;m supporting more than one language for now. 2. while this can produce some wow-effect, I#39;m doubtful about actual usabilty of this. I#39;m more focused on audio quality and the most frequently player functions for now. For example, auto equalizer + custom presets VS that sort of cover flow (which requires hi end devices and won#39;t work well on low end) - equalizer wins. On the visual effect department, the frequency analyzer and wave visualizations are planned. 3. It#39;s not possible to integrate into the system lock screens like that for 3rd party app. Even the standalone custom lock screen will always have issues on some phones due to the non-standardnot-supported APIs - each phone implements it differently and there are at least 200 android models on the market, and yes, all of them has differences in their lock screen implementation.	equalizer,lock screen,version,option
mp3+g karaoke lyric support	First, let me add to the well-deserved chorus of praise for your work on Poweramp. You are consistently working to make an excellent app even better. Thank you. And now to beg for features! Poweramp already supports an extensive list of file formats, and also has the ability to display song lyrics for the playing track. Would it be exceedingly difficult to add support for playing files in the MP3+G and related formats? MP3+G is currently (I believe) the most common format in use by commercial karaoke systems, but there are a small handful of others. I may be getting the details mixed up, but I think MP3+G is essentially a standard MP3 file with additional information about lyrics and the timings to synchronize them with the audio track. This lyrictiming information is either included directly in the MP3+G file, or stored separately in a file with an identical filename (but with a different extension). The lyric display overlay that Poweramp uses now would likely be ill-suited for displaying lyrics synchronized to the audio, as traditionally the karaoke system displays only a few lines at a time. Is including a full-screen, time-synchronized lyric display option possible? Would something like this be better as a separate extension to Poweramp? Thanks once again for the impressive work you#39;ve done so far.	lyrics,display,tag,musicxmatch
stream last.fm stations	It would be a nice addition if Poweramp could stream last.fm stations. This would allow us to take advantage of Poweramp#39;s EQ while listening to streaming audio. It would give it a major leg up on the DoubleTwist and Winamp players.	button,lastfm,song play count,playlist

trial version	Please forgive me if this" issue" ishas been covered. A search turned nothing up for me. I, as all others really like your player, but my question is kind of confusing as most all other apps that I#39;ve had that had trial versions would either require for you to remove the trial version after purchasing the #39;Pro#39; version andor would automatically be removed after reboot. Well, obviously with that not being the case here, should or could we remove the trial version ? B.T.W. I bought it through the Market if that is a factor, which I can#39;t imagine it being. *Thanks!

delete protection	First, best audio player out there. I would love a delete protection option in the settings. Perhaps a check box that when checked, disables the delete buttons. With the buttons so prominent, my clumsy fingers have hit delete a few times. One time, due to my phone hanging a little, I actually deleted the tune. Luckily I had recent backed them up. Perhaps even an exra confirmation level. I love it though and just bought the full version and deleted Mixzing. a	option,lock screen,delete,button
feature request for 2.0: song rating widget	With Song Rating planned for 2.0 I would like to ask MaxMP to add a simple 5 stars widget in sizes 2x1 and 4x1 (with song name and album art) that is used to rate the currently played song. I use to rate my newly listened songs on iPod Touch thanks to how easy it is to use rating from iPod app. On Android it is not that easy but should be even easier thanks to such widget.	widget,playlist,screen,album art

few suggestions...	Yeah, as title states, I#39;ve got a few suggestions that#39;d make my life easier: 1. Option to always return to player from the equalizer settings when you press the back button. 2. Option to when you listen to a song and touch the previous song button, I#39;d prefer to have it play the current song from the start instead of going back to the previous song if your more than 5-10 seconds into the current song. This is how other players usually behave so I atleast would like that option. 3. Ability to quene songs or atleast add it as either next or last song in the current playlist your playing. 4. Ability to customize the track order in playlists, like if I had a playlist with 5 songs in it, and want song #3 in the list to be the first song to play instead and #4 to be the last to play... 5. Save custom presets for the equalizer, and maybe edithidedelete the default presets? Yeah, I guess thats all, must say that I am a happy owner of the full version ^^	version,equalizer,playlist,screen

track numbers on player screen	I wanted to request the addition of track numbers on the main player screen somewhere near the artist, album, song info. For example if an album had 15 tracks and you were playing track 11 it would read: 1115. This would let you know how far you were in an album or playlist without having to check the library.	playlist,album art,screen,album
poll poll: social networking in your music app?!	I have now seen two posts asking for social networking and am seriously concerned this amazing app is going to turn into some social networking crap. I do not see any reason someone has a need to spam the internet with what music they are playing on their cell phone. By adding social networking to this music app it runs the risk of using excessive battery life due to network use and the added permissions needed lead to security risks. There are many other feature suggestions here that have far more importance then stupid social networking. IMO the dev should be focusing time on those features and not one that only little brat children will use. My phone has enough social networking bloatware installed on it from Motorola, no need to add more. If you choose yes, I would love to hear what kind of logic you are using and reasoning for wanting social network integration. Do you actually think people care what song you are listening to? Are you that arrogant you need to push that info on the world? Do you really need to look "cool" to your friends online by showing you are playing a certain song? What actual use does broadcasting to the world what you are playing on your phone have?	button,playlist,play,search

love poweramp, two suggestions...	Hey, just discovered Poweramp and I am so impressed by it! It rocks and is so far the best player I have seen and tried out, I love it! Great work!!! And keep it going! I noticed one thing that I would like being implemented in a future upgrade...24h-option on the lockscreen, for the time, that would work better for us here in Sweden! And also, an option to choose to queue tracks to a playlist that you are already playing, like in the Winamp-app just released for Android. It#39;s often that I listen to an album, and want to add new tracks to the playlist or album. The queue-function is great! Just some ideas! Keep it going!!!	playlist,lockscreen,play,queue

manual order to re-scan folders	Hi there, it seems to me, that right now power amp re-scans folders only on event of being unplugged from the PC ( or maybe SD card mounted ). However it doesn#39;t re-scan on actual change in the folder. Example: I download podcast via wireless with podcatcher and save the mp3 file into folder that is supposed to be scanned by power-amp. The file doesn#39;t appear added until I mount the phone to PC and back. Could it be possible to add some command to menusettings which would allow to re-scan folders?	folder,library,playlist,tag
quot;add to now playing queuequot; needed. then its perfect	I absolutely love this music app. I had mixzing before but I like your designlayout and features more. I feel like this app has the best set of features that you need and it looks good, while keeping it basic and simple. That#39;s not easy to accomplish. That being said, in order for this to be the hands down best music app it needs the ability to add songalbumartist to the now playing queue. I imagine it would be an option when you hard click (press and hold) a songalbumartist along with "add to pl" "play all" "shuffle all" "delete all" which are already there. I love being able to easily make a playlist on the fly with out having to save and reopen a playlist. Right now this is the best all around music player available, but with this addition it will be best music player period. You#39;ve really nailed all of the basic features people look for in a music player. Keep up the great work and I look forward to the updates you#39;ll be releasing.	playlist,option,button,play

I#39;d like to start off that I absolutely love this player, and I can#39;t wait to purchase it.However, I would really like a way to get back to the now playing "Player" part of the app without having to use the physical buttons on my Droid X.

change tracks by long-pressing volume button	I have no idea if this is possible within the constraints of the Android API, but I figure it#39;s worth asking.... One of the (few) things I miss from my Blackberry Storm is the ability to change tracks by long-pressing the volume buttons. I considered that function absolutely invaluable on a touchscreen device, especially since I keep my phone holstered (face-in) on my hip. My implementation of choice would be to hook the Volume-Up, Volume-Down, and Camera buttons when the screen is locked. Long-pressing Camera would toggle PlayPause. Holding down Volume UpDown would trigger NextPrevious after about 34 of a second. A short press of Volume Up or Down would change the volume by one notch on button-release. The lack of this feature is the sole reason I still sometimes pull out my Storm to listen to music, when I know I#39;ll be in a situation that would make touch-controls inconvenient.	volume,button,screen,playlist

lockscreen, tag editor	Hey MaxGreat job with PA! The fact that I can finally start using all my HE-AACv2 encoded music again, thus freeing several gigs of my SD, is enough to make me buy this. All the other awesome features are just sugar coating. Now for the features I#39;ve had in mind:Lockscreen:1. It would be nice to have the controls stuffed away in a drawer, e.g. just show the cover with artistalbumtitle info and have the user slide this up to reveal the actual controls. This way accidental key presses due to screen turning on would be prevented (see e.g. Mort Player for inspiration). 2. I#39;d appreciate if you could make sure future versions of PA cooperate nicely with Widgetlocker. There#39;s some code given on the WL website on how to enabledisable or suspendresume WL while other lockscreen apps are running. I guess you could implement it so that WL gets suspended whenever the PA lockscreen is running, then resume WL once PA is pausedstopped? Would be great for it#39;d finally make it possible to have a decent player with lockscreen controls AND a customized lockscreen for general use.You can find the relevant code here: http:teslacoilsw.c...ckerdevelopersTag editing:It would be nice to have the option to quickly edit tags on a per-album level, meaning editing tags globally for all files in a folder an album instead of having to do it for each song. Would come in very handy whenever one realizes that e.g. a whole albums genre is wrong.Thanks for considering and keep it up!	lockscreen,button,tag,playlist
support for free-form genres multiple values per tag	It seems Poweramp only uses the static genre list from ID3v1 and ignores the custom ID3v2 genre tags I#39;ve added to my songs. Since the static list is very limited it would be great if the values from the tags could also be used.On a related note, my desktop music player (http:code.google.compquodlibet) supports multiple values per tag field by separating them with dashes. I don#39;t know how standardized this is and haven#39;t seen it yet in other players, but maybe you could consider adding this feature? Currently it looks like only the first value will be used (probably because my player only stores the first value in the ID3v1 tag).Are ID3v2 tags actually used at all?	tag,option,info,metadata

shuffle play list	Is there a way to display a list of upcoming songs in a shuffled play order? Pressing on the song title in the player takes you to a list of all the songs on that album. I would rather see what songs are coming up in the shuffle order. I assume that you already know what songs are coming up, since the shuffle feature plays songs in a random order, it doesn#39;t just select the next song randomly. So how can I this? BTW - I like the option to shuffle in the current folder. I often hit a song from an artist I haven#39;t heard in a while, and think I#39;d like to hear a few more of their songs. Now I can just hit the shuffle button to stick with them for a while, and then hit it again to shuffle off to another artist. I don#39;t know if this was your idea originally, but it is brilliant.	playlist,shuffle,sort,button

If the user just wants to play music he has to unlock the phone first. Is it possible to have the lockscreen widget appear even if the player is paused, maybe as a setting? With this fix, the user can start or resume playback from the lockscreen at any time. thanks for reading.	lockscreen,widget,pause,screen
listening history database favorites	I would really like to see a listening history interactive database added. With this in place it could provide the function of a "most listened to" tracks, "newly added" tracks, "least listened to". A "favorites" option could also be added to the app to allow you to taguntag songs as you listen to them as favorites and then have the option to play back favorite tracks in shuffle at any time. Some of these features are available in the iPodiTunes world and would be a very valuable addition to Poweramp. These types of features would make my experience with the app even better than it is now and also give the app added features that would make it stand above the rest even more than it already does. Thank you! Great App! I can#39;t wait to see what comes in the future.	playlist,option,library,button
unhide status bar on menu button press	Hi, I prefer to keep the statusnotification bar hidden while in Poweramp (much more pleasing, aesthetically). Would it be possible to have it displayed when the menu button is pressed, like it does in the EVO#39;s web browser? This way, you wouldn#39;t have to navigate away from Poweramp to view your notifications. Thanks and regards, -Jerry	library,button,playlist,screen
configurable headset button combination presses?	Hi, On my PalmOS Treo, I had a utility program that worked along with Pocket-Tunes. It let you set up various button press combinations, for example - short press long press - raise volume n (you could specify the percentage) long press short press - lower volume n long press long press - previous song It also had a configurable time-out for the time between presses, and a confirmation beep. I don#39;t know if this is possible, but I#39;d love to see it implemented... Thanks and regards, -Jerry	button,volume,search,option
saving equalizer preset	I#39;ll enjoy the possibility to save the custom equalizer setting as new preset. I don#39;t know if it is possible simply or not, but adding to an artist a preset, so that each time you play this artist, the equalizer is ajusted the best way!	equalizer,playlist,library,artist
export files from a playlist	It would be great to be able to export files in a new folder with all the songs of a playlist, so you can share with other people or other devices... (like when we used to burns CD¡äs for family and friends... ) thanks	playlist,folder,tag,library
gestures over album art - pause function	I#39;m definetely quiting the use of the buttons on this wonderful player. I#39;ll quit it once and for all if you could implement pause function (simple click,double click or long click maybe) as a gesture. You#39;re doing a great job! Thanks!	album art,playlist,button,screen
an optional way of going backward down the list hierarchy	First of all I must say I#39;m very much impressed by Poweramp, especially its equalizer. It#39;s the first player that makes my android phone a worthy music player !To the point: I love the fact that in the #39;now playing#39; screen I can click on the table with the song title and progess bar in order to go back to the list of the current album. However, when I click on the up-arrow located in the top right-hand corner of the screen, it takes me to the general albums list, not the albums of the artist I was listening to. I think that it would be more logical this way: I#39;m listening to a song of artist X - click - Reviewing the album I am listening to - click - Reviewing albums of artist XThat way it will be easier to navigate among albums of the same artist. As for now, the quickest way to select a different album of the artist I#39;m listening to at a given moment is to click the menu button, click "folderslib", select "artists", find the desired artist and only then see the albums I wanted. What do you think? Of course, if someone prefers to use it the way it is now, this could be made optional in the settingsCheers	library,artist,option,sort
track order vs. alphabetical order for albums	It would be great if the music on an album could be played in the track order that it was intended by the musician, rather than in alphabetical order. It is kind of weird listening to a live album when it is all jumbled up. Thanks!	playlist,album,sort,artist

adjustable widget opacity	this request is for a setting to adjust the opacity of the widget background. Right now I happen to be using a backgroundwallpaper against which the widget text below the track title is hard to read. Allowing for a lower opacityhigher transparency widget background would help strike a balance between transparency and readability. In case anyone#39;s curious, the background i#39;m using is a landscape photo with sky and water (read: mostly blue of varying shades). I figure this is a common enough type of background to make this a noteworthy issue. Thumbnail attached. anyway, thanks for reading.	widget,album art,display,playlist

now playing playlist direct button to library	Hi, thanks for a great player. As soon as I heard EQ working, I didn#39;t hesitate to shop for it. This app seems promising. I have two suggestions: 1) Playlist management is pretty poor at this stage. Although I don#39;t really use created playlists that much , I really miss Now Playing playlist, which is dynamically created on the go and holds tracks queued for listening. Also, currently the playlists are way too hidden, and I couldn#39;t figure out how to change order of songs in a given playlist ... probably it is not possible. 2) I miss button which would take me directly to the "root" folders menu, where I can pick folder to play. Right now this is possible only on two clicks, I think choosing different album deserves dedicated button. Thanks for great work	playlist,button,library,folder
facebook integration	Would love to be able to post my current song#39;s information to Facebook automatically. Audiogalaxy has this feature along with a Twitter update.	playlist,display,album art,button
extra large album art widget	I#39;m really happy with this music player after trying many and after a fast forward option is added (sounds like it will be soon) it will be nearly perfect for me. One thing I would like to see is the large album art widget to be a full 4x4 screen size. Check out mixzing#39;s large album art widget. Would be a nice option to have, it really sexes up one of my home screens. Thanks for listening.	album art,widget,playlist,screen
make poweramp default	My Incredible (Froyo) seems to make the default music player whatever was installed last, and any bluetooth controls which seek to control music will only trigger that program. If you install a sound program after Poweramp (such as an audiobook reader) that takes control as the default. Is there any way you can make a touch-option that would make Poweramp the default player?	bluetooth,album art,button,version

flac 24bits and autopause	Hi Your player is so good that i can use it in concerts to playback songs and sing on it ! :mrgreen: I only miss 2 things : support for FLAC 24bits and an autopause functiun when playing a folder or a playlist. Anyway great work, i#39;ll buy asap and wait updates like a child ! Abgraal	playlist,tag,folder,play
play all albums by artist	Currently when you select Play All in artist view (library) it sorts all songs by tack number. An option to play through albums in order would be a welcome addition. Currently you have to create a new playlist and add each album to the playlist. That#39;s an annoying extra step.	playlist,artist,library,album
notifications on unlock screen	It be great to have a notifications on the unlock screen for things like emails, texts and missed calls. Also make it so you can click on them and go straight to the message. I think that is will look better with a few icons than having the bar with the lock screen.	screen,lock screen,button,option
album art choice	Hi, thanks for this great music player! But I have a questionrequest concerning the album art. Is it possible to choose from a variety of potential pics? I know this option from other players. Because in my case the downloaded album art pics are not really well chosen (band pics instead of the album art, wrong album art...). Thanks a lot!	album art,screen,tag,display
edit multiple tag	Hi By using your application, I thought of an other feature that could be helpfull: the possibility to change multiple tag. For exemple, when an album#39;s genre is tagged as "default", we have to change manually each song. Quiet annoying. Maybe we can have the possibility to edit the tag from the albumartist library (long press, the same way as with song)? Thanks for correcting it	tag,playlist,artist,library
switch between album art and visualizations in widget	In the widget, It would be really cool to switch between album art and the built-in visualizations like the stock android player does. More visualizations would be cool too, like an old school EQ, showing the 100Hz, 1000Hz bands jumping up and down, or an Oscilloscope showing the wave pattern...	album art,car,tablet,screen
customizable player screen	You see, Power AMP already has a beautiful interface, but sometimes it just feels like there are too many stuff on the screen. Because of the gestures, the forward and backward buttons get a little obsolete and its not like I use the equalizer all the time. We should be able to chose what to show on the player screen. If I want to see only the album art and the tagsfile and duration, so be it! It would be fantastic to have the player the way we like it. Is it possible?	screen,album art,version,equalizer
make the unlock button on lock widget screen swipable..	Currently it is too easy to press in its button form. If you make it something where user has to swipe to unlock, it will make it safer.	button,lock screen,widget,screen
clicking the quot;menu upquot; button when coming from main ui	So I#39;ve been playing around with the player for the past couple of hours, and I really love it and will definitely buy it, there is just one really small thing that would make this player, in my eyes, almost perfect: When on the main player screen, if you click on the little "list" button above the song name to go to the list of songs you own that are in the same album, and then click the up arrow button in the upper right corner to go to the next organizational level, it would be a lot easier if it went to the Artist instead of all owned albums (like, it should go to the artist the album was made by, with the list of the other albums you have by them). It does this if you use the library function to find your song, and then press the "menu up" button without going to the player screen, but once you do go to the player screen it will just go to a list of all albums, regardless of the artist. I know that this is a really small thing, but I feel like it allows for easier changes between songs, especially if you want to listen to a lot of songs by the same artist. I#39;m sorry if that made absolutely no sense, and I#39;ll clarify if needed. Otherwise I looooveeee Poweramp and thanks for developing such a great app!!	button,artist,library,playlist
feture requests amp; thank you : )	First, your app is amazing. Android needed a good music app, and this one seems to be better then the rest I have tried. Music being played out of the phones speaker now sounds much better. The widgets look great (simple clean, thank you!) and provide just the right options. Suggestions are as follows:A playlist button on the widgets. The two extra folder buttons on the widget are no longer there when I switched from playing tracks in folders to playlists. I would love to see those two buttons on the widget which are there in folder view also there in playlist view, but used cycle back and forward through your different playlists. It would be nice to see a shuffle button too on the widget to shuffle the current folderplaylist.I would love an option to use visualizations instead of album artwork. Being able to full screen visualizations would be nice too. I often hook up my Droid X to HDTV#39;s using the HDMI out (and Real HDMI App) then output music to the TV#39;s speakers. Trippy flashing colors, patterns, tunnels, designs, etc through visualizations would look great. See: http:www.winamp.comvisualizations I would love to see several different options.This next one may require a bug fix from google. Android (STILL) can#39;t display ID3v2 Genre tags correctly. We are stuck with the old ID3v1.1 Tagging which has premade genres and does not allow for custom tagging in the genre field. Ironically, ID3v2 came out back in the late 90#39;s well before Android was even a conceptual design.The lock screen really needs a swipe to unlock instead of a single button before it can replace the default phone lock screen. The button is just to easy to accidentally press which prevents using the apps option to replace its lock screen wo using the default one too. No need for redundancy if the button changes to a swipe type unlock (like the Android system one, iPhone, etc) The lock screen would be even better if you could select playlists.I would love an option to have the app automatically power down itself in event of low battery. This could be an option setting where the user can pick a certain phone battery level the app automatically shuts it self down.Gapless playback, crossfade songs, and a volume level check option (to playback all songs at the same volume, even if one mp3 is louder then the other one) would be great.Lastly an Exit button in the setting menu to shut the app down completely. I hat leaving apps running when not in use. Task killing it is a PITA.Thats all I can think of for now. Keep up the great work!	equalizer,all,repeat option,last played
musepack and peak-meter ?	Hi Maxim! Poweramp - my favorite Player! It#39;s simply the best. Poweramp Mixzing (looks better, codecs, equalizer works with every codec) Poweramp Winamp (EQ, codecs) Would love to see: * Musepack (*.mpc) support (This would be killer! It#39;s open source, fast and offers great SQ) * Peak meter with clipping Also, take a look at the xda-developers forums, if you didn#39;t already! There is huge support!	equalizer,version,option,display

gapless playback	Hi. I assume you receive a lot of requests with this, but I think gapless music playback is ESSENTIAL for a music player nowadays. No Android player does that properly so far, so supporting this will give you a BIG competitive advantage. I¡äve read that it was supported a few builds back, and since it¡äs not present I guess some errors were found. Please, would you consider it? Thanks in advance	playback,tag,playlist,option
scrolling notification in status bar at song change	This is an awesome app and I really enjoy using it. I feel weird requesting a feature for an app that I haven’t paid for (hopefully I can soon…), but one thing that I’ve wished for in most music apps is that there would be a scrolling notification in the status bar at each song change which would contain the artist name and song title. Last.FM’s app does that and I really like it. Hopefully that makes sense… Handcent SMS does this as well when it receives a text (as I#39;m sure other messaging apps do). Thanks	button,display,artist,playlist
move to memory card and more	Hi I love your music player, but I would really like to see these features: * Move to memory card (froyo) * When headset is connected and longpress on volume rocker you change to nextprevious song * A widget with white text and buttons (instead of the blueish glow) * Album art in the library list Keep up the good work!

track order sorting for folders	I use "Folders" to play my FLAC music, but I currently have all my tracks named without their Track Numbers - this information is all in the Tag of the track. But currently there is no way to sort by Track number and as such my sort order is out of sync when playing by folder. sidenote I then tried to use the "Library" but that particular album did not appear - anyway to refresh the library? The re-scan folders doesn#39;t seem to have an effect for my library and FLAC files :? Thanks in advance and keep up the great product.	library,tag,sort,artist

default music player presets	I love most of the features of Poweramp like the equalisers and tone controls, less gaps between songs, interface, etc. But I frankly still feel the quality or rather the preset equaliser settings in the stock music player is very good.. (i use the #39;Rock#39; equaliser and #39;Normal#39; effect in the stock music player).. Can you see what equaliser settings can give that same effect as I am not able to emulate it myself? In other words add the default music player equaliser settings in the presets of Poweramp.. For eg. When I set Samsung Rock default in Poweramp it will sound like the stock music player.. Thanks	version,equalizer,option,sound
wired remote triple-click support?	The latest version added double-click support, which is great. Would it be possible to extend that to triple click-support? In the other app bTunes, it accepted input from my wired headset wherein single-click playpause, double-click forward one track, and triple-click skip backwards one track. I loved this functionality, and it worked just fine with my old iPhone headset with wired micremote. I#39;m not sure about how the implementation works, but if double-click is supported just fine, and triple-clicking to rewind worked in another app, hopefully it#39;s not impossible to incorporate into Poweramp Congrats on the great app and big publicity. Looking forward to being able to send some money your way when the app is officially released. Thanks man! P.S. I will sacrifice many livestock in your honor when v2.0 rolls around with gapless playback :]	version,bluetooth,iphone,button
volume control on wired remote control	Hi, Thanks for a great music player. I#39;m waiting for the final version to buy it, because it really notice the effort and dedication you put into it. I would like to request a feature, I saw that in this latest release, has implemented the function of double click on the wired remote control to skip forward or backward a song, I asume that#39;s to avoid accidental touches. I think it would be more useful if this will work to raise and lower the volume on the player, in that way it would not be necessary to remove the phone from the pocket or whereever it is to access this feature. If you need beta testers, please let me know ! Regards, PS: Translated from Spanish by Google Translator me	translation,version,volume,button
stop at the end of a folder	If the last track in a folder has been played, the player automatically starts playing the first song of the next folder. It would be great to have the possibility to choose in the settings, if the player plays the next folder or if the player stops playing at the end of the folder (and jumps back (paused) to the first song of the played folder - like a cd in the cd-player)	folder,playlist,library,button
voice search?	This thing seems to have everything else I want (except the ability to be purchased ), but it would be cool if it registered itself as a voice search handler. That way, you can say "listen to (artistalbumsong)" and it would come up to handle it. Thanks!	control,voice control,voice,search

sort library by album artist	This would be an awesome feature as many albums have artist written in different ways or featuring artists and so on. + the whole various artists albums can really clog up the list of artists. For instance I have Dr Dre - 2001. But if I scroll to Dre under Artists it shows as 20 lines Dr Dre, Snoop DoggDr. Dre, Eminem and so on. Whit Album Artist sorting this would show as only Dr. Dre. Click it and you can see his albums. When playing you can show the artist of the individual song. This is my dream. Fulfill it please?	artist,sort,library,album artist
lyric show please	this Great Application for Android, the Best I think.... it would be Great if this app can show the Lyric, this app already can read the ID3 lyric tag .????, now its time to show the lyric, scrolling lyric please, with album art as a background...??? sorry for my poor english....	tag,lyrics,musicxmatch,andlyrics
delete after listening (for podcasts)	I would love to use Poweramp as my primary media player. The only thing stopping me from doing so is that I listen to far more podcasts than I do music tracks. It would be very useful for managing podcasts if there were an option to have them auto delete after listening. Thank you for your excellent app.	option,playlist,lock screen,delete

gestures in lockscreen	hi, I am really searching for a good Music Player. I used always btunes because it has this great feature of showing in fullscreen the current song. I found your great player and it does the same which is really nice. Still the Library an Folder Buttons are really small, and I have to check if it recognises my Playlists, but there is one big feature I am missing. The gestures while playing a song are awesome but it would be more awesome if this would work also on the lockscreen. Because I am jogging a lot and I know it from the Samsung Player, my old Iphone and so on, when you are on the run and want to get to the next Song you have to search with your finger the NEXT Button on the Screen. The normal Samsung Player doesn#39;t have a Lockscreen Widget at all, and on the iPhone it was always difficult to press exactly the NEXT Button while running. btunes made it really good and allowed with a swipe to left or right to play the next or last song. This was amazing while running, because it was so smooth and easy, without looking on the screen. The problem is btunes lost his developers or anything, because since may there wasn#39;t any update and it has really big difficulties with Froyo. therefore I am back to Samsung Player and now putting all my hope into Power AMP. The widget is still a good think, but the final point whould be the gestures on the lockscreen. would be nice but I buy it anyway if it hits the market	lockscreen,version,iphone,widget
